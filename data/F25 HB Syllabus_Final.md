Course  Description   Healthy  boundaries  are  key  to  healthy  and  ethical  leadership.  They  are  meant  to  create  a  safer
and

more

liberative

space

so

that

your

ministry

can

ﬂourish.

This

course

draws

from

multiple





disciplines  and  perspectives  to  resource  reﬂection  on  why  healthy  boundaries  are  important
as

part

of

a

professional

ethic

of

ministry

and/or

leadership,

potential

complexities

one

might

encounter

when

trying

to

set

and

maintain

healthy

boundaries,

and

generative

practices

for

integrating

care

for

self

and

others

in

a

variety

of

contexts.

Course

materials

and

conversations

will

explore

themes

such

as

intersections

of

social

location

and

power

dynamics,

sexual

health

and

ethics,

trauma-informed

leadership,

and

navigating

boundaries

as

a

part

of

ﬂourishing

relationships

in

a

time

of

fragmentation

and

polarization.

Individual

and

collaborative

assignments

provide

opportunities

to

practice

critical

and

generative

reﬂection

and

expression.
Your  colleagues  and  instructor  will  accompany  and  support  your  work  this
semester

as

Course  Policies    These  policies  and  procedures  are  speciﬁc  to  our  course,  although  there  are  also  items  that
reference

MLTS

Policies

and

the

Student

Handbook.

Any

items

that

are

also

MLTS

policies

are

also

noted

as

such.

Communicating  about  the  course   Our  multiplatform  format  invites  us  to  be  intentional  about  how  we  share  information.  Here
are

some

notes

on

how

I

will

communicate

with

you

about

class.

Syllabus:  The  syllabus  is  the  instructive  document  for  the  course.  At  times  the  syllabus  will
direct

you

to

the

course

Populi

page

for

more

detail.

If

you

have

a

question

and

cannot

ﬁnd

the

answer

in

the

syllabus

or

on

the

Populi

page,

please

be

in

touch.





Populi:  Populi  is  a  “home  base”  website  for  the  course.  The  course  site  contains  the  syllabus,
weekly

modules

with

readings

and

assignments

from

the

course

schedule,

full

assignment

descriptions,

links

to

upload

your

assignments,

a

gradebook,

and

a

class

discussion

board.
Group  updates:  I  send  occasional  notes  to  the  class  in  two  ways.  First,  I  will  use  the  course
discussion

board

on

Populi.

When

a

post

is

made

to

the

discussion

board,

you

will

also

receive

an

email

notiﬁcation.

I

use

the

discussion

board

for

information

that

is

public

and

that

can

be

easily

referenced

as

we

move

throughout

the

semester.

If

a

message

is

for

the

good

of

the

group

but

requires

more

detailed

formatting,

I

will

send

an

email

to

the

full

class.

Discussion  board:   If  you  have  a  question  that  you  think  is  of  beneﬁt  to  the  full  class  –  a  link  is
broken,

you

have

a

question

about

a

date

–

you

can

post

this

to

the

class

discussion

board.

Please

use

your

discretion,

though,

and

communicate

with

me

through

email

regarding

private

matters

such

as

health

concerns

or

class

absences.


Zoom  Etiquette   Presence:  To  the  best  of  your  ability,  keep  multi-tasking  to  a  minimum.  With  gratitude  for  all
the

loved

ones

in

our

lives,

saying

hello

to

housemates,

family

members,

pets,

etc.

is

a

part

of

the

joy

of

our

time

together.

Please

keep

distractions

like

driving

or

other

online

activity

to

a

minimum.

Cameras:  The  default  setting  for  our  class  will  be  to  keep  cameras  on.  This  helps  us  create  a
sense

of

presence

with

one

another.

There

will

be

times

when

you

will

need

to

turn

your

camera

off

for

a

brief

time.

You

do

not

need

to

let

me

know.

For

extended

times

with

the

camera

off,

please

send

me

a

direct

message

so

I

can

discern

how

you

might

continue

to

be

involved

in

class.

For

example,

if

you

need

to

turn

your

camera

off

because

you

are

not

feeling

well,

I

will

not

call

on

you;

if

your

internet

is

wonky

but

you

can

still

use

the

speaker,

I’ll

know

to

still

reach

out

to

you.

Mics:  Please  mute  your  microphone  unless  you  are  speaking.    Zoom  Chat:  The  Zoom  chat  is  another  form  of  class  discussion.  Please  engage  the  chat  only
with

questions

and

comments

that

are

relevant

to

class

material

and

conversation.

Be

prepared

to

further

discuss

any

comments

you

post.

I  endeavor  to  maneuver  between  class  discussion  and  the  chat  in  a  way  that  allows  me  to
practice

deep

listening

to

the

speaker

and

that

also

honors

insightful

contributions

in

the

chat.

This

means

if

someone

is

speaking,

I

will

be

listening

and

not

reading

the

chat,

and

then

I

will

take

intentional

pauses

in

conversation

to

turn

to

the

chat,

read,

reﬂect,

and

integrate.

This

is

a

work

in

process,

and

I

welcome

feedback

about

what

works

and

doesn’t,

and

how

our

virtual,

synchronous

space

can

foster

attention

and

care

for

another

and

our

learning

together.


Class  Recordings   Recordings  of  class  are  made  only  when/if  part  of  an  approved  ADA  accommodation.  At  that
time,

the

instructor

will

share

procedures

with

the

full

class.






Attendance   Per  the  Student  Handbook,  “attendance  is  required  at  all  class  sessions.  Please  arrive
promptly.

Students

with

more

than

four

unexcused

absences

(absence

=

missing

half

or

more

of

any

class

session)

will

receive

a

failing

grade

in

the

course.”

I

want

to

support

your

success

in

this

class.

Please

email

me

as

soon

as

possible,

and

no

later

than

24

hours

prior

to

class,

regarding

any

absences.


Plagiarism    This  section  on  plagiarism  is  only  part  of  the  very  rich  instruction  on  plagiarism  provided  in  the  Student  Handbook (pp.  44-49).  For  example,  the  Handbook  contains  additional  sections  on  citations,  self-plagiarism/multiple  submissions,  and  AI.  I  encourage  you  to  review  those
sections

in

addition

to

this

information.

“Plagiarism  is  using  any  source  in  work  submitted  for  evaluation  and  grading,  without  proper
acknowledgment.

Sources

can

be

anything

ranging

from

(but

not

limited

to)

published

and

unpublished

works,

books,

articles,

sermons,

lectures,

websites,

videos,

and

even

your

own

previously

submitted

papers.

Plagiarism

is

an

extremely

serious

offense

toward

the

scholarly

community,

one

that

can

result

in

an

academic

sanction.

Ordinarily,

instances

of

plagiarism

are

discovered

by

the

faculty

member

who

has

the

authority

to

confront

a

student,

assess

the

gravity

of

the

instance,

and

determine

the

academic

consequences

within

the

course

in

question,

up

to

and

including

the

assignment

of

a

failing

grade.

The

faculty

member

must

also

report

all

instances

of

plagiarism

to

the

Senior

Director

of

Contextual

Ministry,

providing

the

documentation

of

the

alleged

plagiarism

and

a

description

of

the

measures

taken

by

the

faculty

member,

including

grade

implications.

General

requirements

for

the

proper

acknowledgment

of

sources

of

academic

work

are

as

follows.

To  avoid  plagiarizing,  you  must  properly  acknowledge  your  sources  through  citations.
Whenever

you

quote

speciﬁc

words

or

phrases,

paraphrase

an

author’s

original

idea,

or

refer

to

someone’s

original

work—whether

that

be

research

data,

a

creative

work

of

art,

a

social

media

post,

etc.—you

must

properly

acknowledge

from

whom

and

where

those

words,

ideas,

data,

facts,

etc.

came

from

through

a

citation.

This

applies

to

any

work

you

submit

or

publish

as

a

student,

whether

it

be

a

thesis,

a

course

paper,

or

even

a

relatively

informal

discussion

post.”

Citation  Guide   For  Reading  Responses  only,  use  this  parenthetical  citation  style  that  is  (“author  last  name,
page”).

Ex:

(Tawwab,

12).

All

other

citations

should

adhere

toTurabian/Chicago

formatting

practices.

Grading  Rubrics   Assignments  will  be  graded  according  to  the  rubrics  in  Populi.

250-300

words

(~1-1.5

page).

August

21

entry

is

required

+

4

of

your

choosing.

See

syllabus

and

Populi

for

prompts.

Final

due

11/20,

11:59p.
This  exercise  invites  you  to  deepen  your  understanding  of  healthy  boundaries  through
extended

reﬂection

on

an

object,

image,

or

short

audio

piece

that

sparks

and

inspires

your

thinking

about

healthy

boundaries.

Throughout

the

semester,

you

will

see

journal

prompts

on

the

syllabus

(and

included

in

Populi)

that

invite

reﬂection

on

your

image/object

inspired

by

course

readings

and

conversations.

The

ﬁrst

introductory

prompt

is

required,

and

then

you

will

choose

four

additional

prompts

throughout

the

semester.

Instructions  1.  Choose  an  image,  object,  or  musical  reﬂection  that  sparks  your  thinking  about  healthy
boundaries.

Perhaps

this

is

something

that

prompts

questions,

surfaces

complexities,

or

makes

clear

pronunciations

-

your

choice!

Musical

selections

should

be

under

one

minute.
2.  In  our  second  class  on  August  21,  you  will  introduce  your  item  in  90  seconds  or  less.
Why

did

you

choose

it?

What

about

this

item

inspires

you

to

center

it

as

part

of

your

reﬂection

this

semester?

While

you

do

not

have

to

submit

anything

written

in

the

ﬁrst

class,

your

image

and

your

explanation

will

become

your

ﬁrst

Journal

entry.




3.  Four  more  times  throughout  the  semester,  respond  to  the  prompts  with  a  150-250
word

response

or

a

video

recording

of

no

more

than

90

seconds.

Your

entries

can

be

informal

but

should

be

robust

enough

that

they

are

a

resource

to

you

as

you

move

through

the

semester.

Occasionally,

you

will

be

asked

to

draw

from

your

journal

entry

for

class

discussion

(always

optional).

4.  The  collection  of  responses  is  due  11/20,  11:59p.   2.  Guiding  Document  Paper  (20%):  Working  draft  for  9/25  class.  Final  due  9/25,  11:59p.  This  paper  invites  you  to  analyze  the  approach  to  boundaries  in  a  community  of  accountability
familiar

to

you

by

analyzing

a

document

that

guides

life

together

in

that

community.

In

the

paper,

you

will

attend

to

key

background

information

about

the

document

and

its

intended

audience,

provide

historical

context,

analyze

signiﬁcant

commitments

and

practices,

and

reﬂect

on

the

resource

as

it

resonates

with

your

experience

and

context.

You

will

also

discuss

your

ﬁndings

in

class

with

your

colleagues

on

the

assignment

due

date.

The

rubric

is

available

in

Populi.

Requirements  ●  There  are  four  parts  to  the  paper  with  ﬂexibility  within  each  part  for  you  to  study  your
community

in

a

way

that

is

generative

for

your

context.

Attend

closely

to

all

four

parts

of

the

paper.

●  The  paper  length  should  be  1250-1500  words,  not  including  citations.  ●   Include  at  least  one  source  from  class  for  your  paper  ●  Include  your  policy  as  an  appendix  to  the  document.  It  can  be  added  after  your
bibliography

or

shared

as

a

separate

attachment.

Instructions/Structure  Part  I:  Introducing  your  document  (10%,  ~.25  page)   1.  Choose  a  source  from  your  faith  tradition  or  community  that  speaks  to  boundaries  in  that
community.

Examples

include

denominational

statements,

resolutions,

or

ofﬁcial

positions;

policies,

procedures,

or

bylaws;

covenants;

statements

speciﬁc

to

your

local

church;

portions

of

sacred

texts;

handbooks

or

guidebooks;

pamphlets

that

outline

particular

positions;

hymns

and

recent

sermons.

2.  Name  your  community  or  context.  For  whom  is  this  text  signiﬁcant?  Examples  include  your
denomination,

your

congregation,

or

another

community

of

accountability

and

signiﬁcance

for

you.
3.  Articulate  the  approach  to  boundaries  you  are  studying.  What  particular  focus  on
boundaries

will

you

examine

closely

in

this

text

(sexual,

ﬁnancial,

time,

etc.)?
4.  In  a  few  sentences,  why  is  it  important  to  you  to  assess  this  text?    Part  II:  Historical  context  (15%,  ~.5  page)  Provide  historical  context  for  the  source  you  chose.  You  might  choose  to  examine  questions
such

as:

When

was

it

written?

By

whom?

When

was

it

incorporated

into

a

broader

policy

(or

why

was

it

not?).

Has

it

undergone

any

revisions?

Was

there

any

contention

over

the

document?




Part  III:  Surfacing  Boundaries  (30%,  ~2  pages)  Describe  the  community’s  approach  to  boundaries  in  this  document.  Through  examining  what
is

implicitly

and

explicitly

stated,

how

do

they

articulate

beliefs

and

practices

about

healthy

boundaries?

You

might

engage

2

or

3

of

the

following.

●  Named  frameworks  or  arguments  ●  Theoethical  beliefs  and  commitments  ●  Explanations  of  power,  authority,  or  identity   ●  Critical  stakes   ●  Contrasts,  comparisons,  or  juxtapositions  with  other  communities  ●  Particular  practices    Part  IV:  Assessment  (30%,  ~2   pages)  Provide  your  assessment  of  how  the  community  is  engaging  boundaries  according  to  the
features

you

surfaced.

Include

references

to

any

deﬁnitions

of

leadership

and

boundaries

that

you

incorporate.

You

might

track

the

following:

●  What  do  you  appreciate  about  this  source’s  approach  to  boundaries  and  leadership?   ●  What  are  the  strengths  and  limitations  of  the  approaches?  ●  What  do  you  celebrate  in  this  document,  and  what  concerns  you?   ●  What  is  one  perspective  or  approach  you  think  would  make  the  deﬁnition  offered  in
this

source

more

reﬂective

of

maintaining

healthy

boundaries?
Part  IV:  Personal  reﬂection  (15%,  ~.5  page):   Identify  one  insight  from  your  study  that  you  want  to  continue  to  reﬂect  on  this  semester.
Perhaps

you

are

surprised,

grateful,

enraged,

frustrated,

relieved,

profoundly

not

shocked

or

none

of

these…why?

3.  Reading  Responses  (20%):  Due  by  6a  Thursday  before  class  as  noted  in  the  Course
Schedule.

Complete

5/9

options.

Responses

are

250-350

words

(~1-1.5

pages).

Reading  Responses  are  a  chance  to  critically  engage  key  insights  and  frameworks  in  course
materials.

They

are

not

exhaustive

treatises

but

opportunities

for

close

reading

and

generative

reﬂection.

Your

engagement

with

course

readings

and

class

conversations

help

foster

a

culture

of

learning

and

collaboration.

Instructions   1.  Choose  a  key  idea  or  concept  from  one  of  the  readings  that  is  striking,  provocative,
confusing

or

curious.

In

125-175

words,

articulate

major

points

of

the

key

idea

or

concept.

Stay

close

to

the

text.

How

does

the

author

deﬁne

this

concept,

make

an

argument

for

why

a

framework

is

important,

or

describe

the

practice?

Cite

the

work

carefully

as

you

go,

including

page

numbers

for

ideas

or

quotes.
Examples  include:  ●  signiﬁcant  deﬁnitions  or  frameworks  ●  theological  or  psychological  themes  ●  an  important  argument,  refutation,  or  assertion  ●  promising  practice



2.  Then  turn  to  analysis.  As  a  generous  reader,  and  in  125-175  words,  analyze  the  author's
contributions.

You

might

address:

●  strengths  and/or  limitations  of  their  perspective  ●  how  their  thinking  enriches  your  understanding  of  holding,  sustaining,   or
re-evaluating

healthy

boundaries
●  other  perspectives  that  would  broaden  their  approach    3.  For  Reading  Responses  only,  use  this  parenthetical  citation  style  that  is  (“author  last  name,
page”).

Ex:

(Tawwab,

12).

4.  Post  your  Response  as  a  Discussion  Board.  Responses  to  colleagues  are  not  required,  but
you

are

welcome

to

do

so.

Logistics  and  Notes  ●  Keep  track  of  your  completion.  The  ﬁrst  ﬁve  weeks  you  don’t  submit  a  Response  are
excused

(you’ll

see

an

“E”

on

Populi).

●  To  enhance  conversation  for  the  weeks  that  you  are  not  presenting  in  the  Navigating
Boundaries

Series,

you

are

encouraged

to

read

the

text

and/or

view

the

video

or

podcast

selections.

You

can

submit

a

Reading

Response

on

the

required

or

supplementary

materials

that

week.

4.  Navigating  Boundaries  Presentation  (15%):  Small  groups  will  present  on  10/23,  10/30,
and

11/06.

Full

assignment

includes

a

presentation

and

a

Reading

Response.

The

presentation

is

given

in

class

and

the

Reading

Response

is

due

by

11:59p

the

day

of

presentation.
This  assignment  is  an  opportunity  to  collaboratively  lead  reﬂection  on  a  key  issue  in  this
contemporary

moment

that

necessitates

discerning

and

maintaining

healthy

boundaries.

There

are

three

texts

in

the

“Navigating

Boundaries”

series:

10/23  Jonathan  Haidt  -  The  Anxious  Generation:  How  the  Great  Rewiring  of  Childhood  Is   Causing  an  Epidemic  of  Mental  Illness    10/30  Loretta  J.  Ross  -  Calling  In:  How  to  Start  Making  Change  with  Those  You’d  Rather   Cancel   11/06  Vivek  Murthy  -  Together:  The  Healing  Power  of  Human  Connection  in  a  Sometimes   Lonely  World    These  texts,  written  by  signiﬁcant  public-scholars  from  different  disciplines,  focus  speciﬁcally
on

technology,

conﬂict,

and

addressing

loneliness;

however,

more

broadly,

each

of

these

texts

explores

themes

like

relationships,

power,

isolation,

and

care.

These

are

compelling

issues

for

leaders

seeking

to

care

for

themselves

and

others

well

amid

many

competing

urgencies.
Instructions   1.  On  the  ﬁrst  day  of  class,  you  will  sign  up  for  your  presentation  date.


2.  Small  groups  will  coordinate  together  on  their  presentation.  The  presentation  is  given
in

the

ﬁrst

half

of

class.

3.  The  presentation  should  introduce,  investigate,  and  analyze  key  ideas  and  themes  in
the

week’s

readings

and

encourage

class

engagement.
4.  A  Reading  Response  is  also  due  by  11:59p  the  day  you  present.  5.  Creativity  is  invited!  Please  reach  out  to  discuss  possibilities  or  questions.    Logistics  and  Notes  ●  Similar  to  submissions  for  the  Reading  Responses,  you  will  be  excused  (you’ll  see  an
“E”

on

Populi)

from

the

days

you

don’t

present.

5.  Final  Integrative  Project/Paper  (35%  total):  See  dates  below  (ﬁnal )   Your  ﬁnal  integrative  project  affords  you  a  chance  to  robustly  engage  a  topic  related  to  healthy
boundaries
