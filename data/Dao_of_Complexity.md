Advance Praise for The Dao of Complexity





“In the West we are shifting from seeing the world as ordered, inherently perfect, me-chanical, and in equilibrium, to seeing it as alive, messy, organic, and ever in process. Jean Boulton captures this shift in thinking beautifully, with insight and precision.”

—W. Brian Arthur, author of Complexity and the Economy

“This is my book of the year. Some books fill your head, some your heart, some educate, some set you alight; Jean’s book does all of these. Her sparkling irrepressible scholar-ship takes us on a journey from the profound to the practical and incites us to cultivate ourselves and face the future. Essential fare for any progressive business school, and I’d also recommend it as a refreshing holiday brain reboot.”

— Jon Foster-Pedley, Dean and Director,

Henley Business School, Africa

“Wonderfully wide-ranging and thoughtful, Jean Boulton doesn’t explain complexity, she inhabits it. Through musings, stories, and a breath-taking range of ideas, Boulton is an inspiring companion who teases out the connections to Daoist cosmology with deceptive ease. An essential read for anyone wanting to make a difference.»

— Margaret Gearty, Associate Professor,

Hult International Business School (Ashridge)

“Drawing together her deep understanding of the complexity sciences, and a voracious appetite for ideas from other disciplines, Jean Boulton writes with wit and wisdom to argue that the contemporary dilemmas we face on our planet today demand new, processual ways of thinking. Wide-ranging and compelling, this is an absorbing and fascinating read.”

— Chris Mowles, Professor of Complexity and Management,

Hertfordshire Business School

“A tour de force, fascinating and enticing in equal measure. Jean has gathered a lifetime of thought and reflection and draws on sources that are eclectic yet pertinent and lead to practical insights that anybody can appreciate. Knowing Jean, I see her behind every word and her authenticity is emboldening. A must for academics, practitioners and leaders looking for fresh perspectives and humane answers to the critical challenges of today’s world.”

—Jonathan Davies, Head of International School, Mumbai

“Dialogues between so-called natural scientists, social scientists and practitioners matter more than ever. But they often start badly. Sharing our struggles with complexity can help, and those willing to reflect on their most basic assumptions will gain much from Jean Boulton’s account of how great thinking about complexity converges.”

— James Copestake, Professor of International Development,

University of Bath

vi Advance Praise for The Dao of Complexity



“The very accessible tone in which Jean writes feels like a personal conversation, making challenging topics like process complexity, Daoism, and quantum physics remarkably easy to connect with. Jean invites us into a great conversation, providing profound insights and practical strategies, of benefit to anyone seeking to understand and address the complexities of our ever-changing world.”

— Rika Preiser, UNESCO Chair in Complexity and

Transformative African Futures, Stellenbosch University

“Success in the social world lies not in meticulous planning and control, but in the quality of our engagement with the present moment, as life emerges one step at a time. Jean Boulton shows how the roots of process complexity lie in ancient philosophy as well as in modern science and explores its application to all facets of life, from developing ourselves as individuals to leading organisations and large-scale social change.”

— Andrey Pavlov, Professor of Strategy and Performance,

Cranfield University

Dedication




I would like to dedicate this book to the memory of Peter Allen, a wonderful

engaging warm human being, a teller of stories, a jazz pianist – as well as a leading

thinker and founding pioneer of complexity science.

And to my parents, who would, every so often, ask me what complexity meant and

then regard me with marvel.





Introduction




What is this book about?



Global heating, rising inequality, diminishing resources, geo-political unrest – just a few of the issues causing turbulence in today’s world. We are living in times that are complex and fast-changing. If we can get a handle on the dynamics of this complex global landscape, might we be better equipped to act more skilfully?

The Dao of Complexity starts with an intention to make sense of the nature of complex-ity, a complexity that shows up at all levels: the global, the organisational and the per-sonal. The thesis is that we have adopted the wrong science to guide us in how to live and work in a way that values the sustainability of the future. I hope to convince you that viewing the world as complex will provide good guidance for how to live well, har-moniously and with resilience. The inquiry begins with the physics of open systems, en-gages with other diverse bodies of knowledge, and leads to the articulation of ‘process complexity’ – a framing of the world as processual, contextual and emergent.

The second half of the book then addresses, in a variety of ways, what a complexity worldview suggests for ‘making waves’ – for making a difference in a world of increas-ing connectivity, polarisation and fragility. What does this mean for leadership, change, governance and the way we conduct our personal lives? I chose the phrase making waves as it suggests that what emerges from our actions may not entirely be what we intended. We can make a difference, but we cannot march inexorably towards a cho-sen endpoint.



A chance encounter with the Dao



The seeds for this book were sown one day back in 2004. I was part of Cranfield Uni-versity’s Complex Systems Management Centre under the leadership of Peter Allen. Peter’s background was in theoretical physics, and he had worked for many years with Ilya Prigogine.1 Peter came into the office this particular day clutching a copy of the Dao de Jing, an ancient Chinese philosophical text. ‘Look,’ he said, ‘it reads just like a complexity theory textbook.’ I was intrigued.

The question raised for me that afternoon was this: How is it that the cosmology or worldview emerging from complexity theory – with its roots in the science of open systems – is more or less identical to an experientially informed perspective developed in the Far East in the fourth century B.C.E? It struck me that if inquiries flowing from such unbelievably different starting points arrive at very similar destinations, then maybe we are homing in on something really important. xvi Introduction



After devouring that particular version of the Dao de Jing,2 a translation and com-mentary by Ames and Hall, I started to notice similar resonances with other bodies of knowledge – neuroscience, theories of personal development, early modern pro-cess philosophies. When I came across Carlo Rovelli’s3 views on quantum physics and quantum gravity, and that work also seemed to be reaching not-dissimilar conclusions, I really started to become excited. Simultaneously, I discovered the work of political commentators who had lived through the rise and fall of various kinds of despotism. They, too, had developed perspectives on this complex world that seemed very reso-nant. Here are key words shared by these very different disciplines:

flow, process, pattern, becoming, difference, context, history, diversity,

evolution, paradox, relationship, indeterminism, emergence



Process complexity



I develop the concept of process complexity4 in Section III. This incorporates the idea of a world always in process of ‘becoming’, but, more than that, forsakes the idea of a world made of things; it considers a world constituted of intersecting processes and patterns. The development of process complexity is a central feature of this book: what does it mean to see oneself as more of a process than a thing? What does that mean for the way our various webs of relationships can become ‘established’ and yet are always subject to change? One expression that encapsulates this perspective is to view the world as:

the emerging, stabilising and dissolving of patterns of relationship



The power of mindset

We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created

them. Albert Einstein

I registered the central and primary importance of mindset or worldview when writing Embracing Complexity with Peter Allen and Cliff Bowman.5 Mindset, not method, is the thing.6 Mindsets and beliefs hugely impact what we value, to what we pay attention, how we make sense of what we see and how that, in turn, shapes our choice of methods and mediates our decisions and actions. Without a shift in mindset, we all concluded, nothing really changes. I have become evangelical on this point and this theme imbues the approach I have taken in this book.

I set out to trace the development of the worldview of process complexity and through this I invite you, the reader, to consider your own views about ‘the way the world works’. Is the world, indeed the cosmos, largely static or always changing? Can the future be predicted, or does it emerge? How ‘real’ are things? Are there universal understand-ings to be uncovered or are matters more locally and contextually driven? Complexity theory conveys a view of ‘the way the world works’ that is different from the picture

Introduction xvii



we receive from classical physics. What is that view, with what other bodies of inquiry does it resonate and how might this be of use to those of us, concerned – in both senses of the word – with the social and natural world?

The challenge of changing our worldview is central to our times. Peter Reason7



The still-dominant worldviews from classical physics



Meanwhile, it still seems that the world is primarily in the grip of worldviews driven by two classical – and outdated – physics theories. One, the mechanical worldview, is based on the work of Isaac Newton. Newton essentially was focused on two questions: how the planets travel around the sun, and (essentially) how two billiard balls knock into each other.8 His work was of enormous significance to science; the problem comes when we want it to apply as a ‘theory of everything’. It presents a picture of a world that works like a machine – a world made of bits that operate under the direction of forces, a world that is as predictable as the cogs, wheels and gears of a train engine or a cotton mill. This world is ‘closed’. It is unaffected by anything outside of its own regime. It is reducible to its separate parts. It is predictable. It offers the promise of certainty and control. It is a very tempting metaphor to adopt when we are wanting to organise and manage the human world.

The other physics theory that has gained salience as a worldview focused on the be-haviour of gases and liquids. This theory, from equilibrium thermodynamics,9 also ap-plies to situations closed to outside influences. It promises that things will reach equi-librium and not deviate very far from there.

These classical physics theories, both applicable to closed systems, established the ground in physics for future developments, such as relativity and quantum mechan-ics. They were a huge step forwards in the field of science. The problem arises when we wish to assert that these theories apply to the human world. One particular differ-ence, as I will explore in Section I, is that situations in the human and natural world, and indeed in the galaxies of the heavens, are almost always open to their wider con-texts. They can almost never be regarded as isolated and unaffected by their sur-roundings.

However, starting with the French Enlightenment, those concerned with gover-nance and organisation adopted the mechanical worldview and focused on man-aging through plans, hierarchies, measures and controls. Economists preferred the equilibrium worldview and felt assured that if you minimise control, leave things alone and adopt a laissez-faire approach, then economies will naturally tend towards balance. As one colleague10 pointed out, these are orthodox views, still commonly held. They both in their different ways, simplify things, offer the power of mathe-matics to understand what is going on, and appeal to reason. They make us feel that our human world can be understood through rational means. But, as he said, they xviii Introduction



have become more than merely orthodox; they are hegemonic. They offer dominance and power to those who are in control of a hierarchy or to those who benefit from laissez-faire economics. And those who benefit have a vested interest in leaving things be.

But are these theories really applicable to the dynamics of the social and natural world? Clearly not, when we recognise that situations open to their wider context do not necessarily find balance or reach equilibrium, nor do they function predictably like machines. This was the key breakthrough of Prigogine and others: the word for which, in effect, Prigogine received the Nobel Prize, was open.11 For open systems, we have to dig deeper to explore if there are any general principles that would help in our under-standing. I am hoping that this book plays a part in rattling the iron cage of the machine metaphor, a cage in which our imaginations seem to be imprisoned, held in place by the interests of those who hold its key.



Ontological resonance



But there is a conundrum here. I would be contradicting myself if I were merely to assert that this science of open systems necessarily applies to the social and natural world. I think there are good grounds for this assertion in that I struggle to think of any examples of human or natural situations which, as with the situations of interest to Prigogine and others, are not messy, interconnected and open to their wider surroundings. But nevertheless, I don’t wish merely to assert the validity of transferring complexity ideas from the physical to the natural realm and hence require you, the reader, to accept my word for it and take a leap of faith. The approach I have taken to support this position has been to seek ‘ontological resonance’ with other bodies of knowledge. This began with Peter Allen’s recognition of the resonance between Daoism and complexity theory. But I then found equally strong resonances with other schools of thought – from neuroscience to politics to Pragmatism. I want to share with you my perspective on some of these other bodies of knowledge – ones that are not based on science but seem to reach similar conclusions – so that, armed with this material, you can take your own view.

In addition, I notice that almost all of these bodies of knowledge that resonate with process complexity are experimentally or experientially driven. They are not just ab-stract conceptions or idealisations, but derive understanding from the bottom up, a naturalistic approach to meaning making. Prigogine, too, started with experimental ev-idence. He came across the work of two Russian scientists12 who had found swirls and patterns appearing in chemical systems. This ‘order’ seemed to appear out of nowhere, it seemed counter to expectations and was indeed discounted at the time as probably due to bad experimentation. Prigogine compared this to the work on evolution and found congruence, as I will discuss. The point for me is that his understanding was em-pirically based.

Introduction xix



I am arguing that evolutionary perspectives, the science open systems in the physi-cal-chemical world, and Daoist and other processual empirically derived views of the behaviour of human societies, all seem to be pointing in the same direction. They are surfacing a worldview that is almost indistinguishable from that emerging through the science of complexity. This worldview, in a nutshell, says the world is: intrinsically in-terconnected, diverse, organic, shaped by history and context and ripe with potential. It is a world in which messiness is generative, and where the future emerges in ways that are neither random nor predictable.

I think that this is worth exploring.



What this book covers



The book is in two parts: the first part – Making Sense – starts with theory – of science, complexity, Daoism and other process philosophies. I develop a processual view of complexity. I also explore experiential ways to get to know about this contextual, ever-changing complex world.

The second part – Making Waves – focuses more on what this means we should do – at the level of the individual, the organisation and the global.



Making Sense



There are five sections in this ‘first half’: The long walk of science towards ‘freedom’ as it moves from determinism to indeterminism, the development of and meaning of process complexity, a dive into Daoism, an overview of other resonant perspectives, and a perspective on experiential knowing.

I The Long Walk to Freedom

In this first section, I aim to demonstrate that even the physical universe does not merely unfold according to its universal laws. This is due in part to its inherent messiness and variation, in part to the fact that the universe is full of holes and discontinuities, and in part to its paradoxical nature arising at the tiniest scales. The universe emerges and evolves in ways that are dependent on local conditions, shaped by history and are uncer-tain. There are laws but how they link up is not straightforward, and even if it were, the laws are working on clouds of dust and energy that are not and never were uniform. The universe is interdependent yet incoherent, and it is this incoherence that allows novelty to emerge – including life. This intrinsic indeterminism also provides space for ‘mystery’ and has the potential to return us to a natural philosophy that does not split science from the mystical or spiritual. It provides for a new perspective on what to regard as science.

In ‘Metaphysics and chocolate’, I consider some of the terminology that is relevant to discussions of worldview and ontology. Then I head off into science, starting with xx Introduction



Newton and ending with Prigogine, detouring into quantum physics and evolutionary theory along the way.

II Process Complexity

A processual worldview conveys a world that is in flow, is ‘always becoming’. Further-more, it is a world in which ‘things’ are better thought of as patterns or processes. This may sound hard to swallow, but it is not as far out as it might appear at first glance. It is a view embedded in relational quantum mechanics, it underpins the work of other complexity thinkers such as Ralph Stacey,13 Chris Mowles14 and Paul Cilliers,15 and is postulated by other process thinkers in sociology, biology and philosophy. In this sec-tion, I lay out this processual view of complexity – systemic, patterned, paradoxical, particular to context, path-dependent, punctuated and emergent.

III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?

The third section is an exploration of Daoism, building in particular on the translation and exegesis of Ames and Hall.16 I find their work compelling, scholarly and meticulous. They portray the processual nature of Daoism in language that is both clear and illu-minating and often come to conclusions similar to those reached through the lens of complexity, albeit sometimes using different words and emphasising slightly different aspects.

I have gained a great deal through engaging with this work. Indeed, I don’t think I would have arrived at process complexity by merely steeping myself in complexity thinking. For example, one phrase that encapsulates Daoism and captured my attention is ‘the path is made through walking’. In other words, the future is co-created by everything we, collectively and reflexively, intend, value and put into action.

Wanderer, the road is your footstep, nothing else;

Wanderer, there is no path, you lay down a path in walking.

In walking you lay down a path and when turning around

You see the road you’ll never step on again.

Wanderer, path there is none, only tracks on the ocean foam. Antonio Machado

To give another example: There is emphasis, in Daoism, on the importance of being alert to glimmers of change and how this can help the ‘wise leader’ to seize the mo-ment. I might have reached this notion via complexity thinking, but Daoist texts really bring this alive.

So, I am attracted to Daoism not only because it shares an ontology with complexity but also because it adds perspective and provides suggestion for skilful practice. There is emphasis on how to cultivate our personal capacity to act with the collective future in mind.

Introduction xxi



IV Other Resonant Perspectives

I’ve already considered one processual tradition and that is Daoism. In this section, I briefly explore other processual traditions – process philosophies from Heraclitus to Alfred North Whitehead, process sociology and Pragmatism. I also survey other ap-proaches to complexity – those from more sociological and philosophical traditions, those emerging from biology, and those coming from a more computational founda-tion. I reflect, in all these pieces, on similarities with process complexity, and some dif-ferences too.

V On Experiential Knowing

This fifth section asks: how to explore the complex world? If the world is complex, then ‘knowing’ that world is best approached with methods that reflect that complexity and capture its contextual, path-dependent, patterned nature. As that complex world is not reducible to ‘things connected by forces’, it cannot in general be captured through objective, rational means. To aim to make sense of complex situations requires meth-ods that allow for multiple perspectives and draw on our intuition and instinct as well as our rational faculties. Methods must allow for paradox and must allow for situations to shift over time and for new features to emerge. We also cannot assume we are pas-sive observers with no impact on the situations that we are seeking to explore. Engag-ing holistically and through narrative – not just relying on hard data and analysis – thus become appropriate ‘scientific’ methods when aiming to know the processual complex world. To use academic language, the epistemology has to mirror the ontology. It is not scientific to analyse a situation as if it operates like a machine when it does not. Methods need more subtlety and need to engage with a sometimes poetic and intui-tive sense of what is happening. We are sometimes ‘glimpsing through a glass darkly’ things that are not objectively existent.

This section focuses on experiential knowing. As I discuss in ‘The raw and the cooked’, I am not disputing that there is a place for mapping and modelling, but I feel others can cover this field better than myself. My interest lies in what managers, policymakers, parents and civil society leaders face every day – how to decide what is happening in this situation and what to do about it.



Making Waves



The second half of the book focuses on three different levels – the individual, the organisational and the global. This is not to suggest that these levels are distinct or independent. Equally, as I explore, insights from one level are often relevant in other contexts and at other levels. In these sections, I also consider how some of the bodies of knowledge I draw on resonate with complexity.

xxii Introduction



VI Becoming Ourselves

In Becoming Ourselves, I take a walk around the literature on brain science, consider the implications of left and right hemispherical difference, look at approaches to work-ing with trauma and discuss Gestalt psychology. I end with a memoir17 that explores how embracing personal uniqueness and accepting the ‘life you have’ rather than ‘the life you want’ provides an interesting perspective on the path-dependent, context- specific nature of the complex world.

What I discovered is that the understanding of the brain and the mind-body and the ways we impact and change each other seems extraordinarily consistent with a com-plexity worldview. This is exciting for two reasons:

First, this resonance gives power and substance to the complexity perspective. Views from brain science seem to accord with views from Daoism, and also the work on the physics of open systems, the biology of cells and the ecology of forests. Maybe we are uncovering something about the nature of things that has depth, salience and sub-stance?

Secondly, I find that there are methods embedded in this broad work on the develop-ment of the individual that have wider applicability and can be built on. One example is the way many of these psychological theories emphasise the need to work slowly and consciously with a moment-by-moment stepping through current experience. This method can be adapted to working with organisational change. It also provides a way to unravel any locked-in patterns that have developed due to what has happened to us along the way – the path dependency of our lives.

VII Perspectives on Organisational Practice

Here I include many short perspectives and reflections that pertain to issues of con-cern for managers and policy makers. I include stories and examples: the sagacity of leadership, the structuring of education, the dangers of over-reliance on rules, and the importance of engendering trust. I explore the ramifications of hope, consider the role of ‘agonistic dissent’ in decision-making, promote the practice of focusing on outliers not norms, and explore how to work with paradox without ‘going beige’.

VIII On the Global

In this last section, I start by emphasising the way that we cannot separate the socio-economic from the environmental. I focus the lens of complexity on the field of economics. I tackle the big questions of inequality and limits to growth. I discuss the power of beliefs to shape our economic and political systems and describe how hard it is to come to terms with the potential for runaway change, and the potential for collapse.

In ‘On the political’, I find a fascinating ontological resonance between complexity and the work of various political writers – academics and journalists and those who have lived through difficult regimes. These authors have reflected on what creates power

Introduction xxiii



inequalities, how to arrest their concentration before it becomes too late and how, historically, change has happened. These stories align with complexity concepts – the path dependency of society and how power can become unassailably locked-in to the hands of the few. I find great inspiration in their insights.

Finally, I consider the developing polycrisis of our times and draw together some con-clusions as to what ‘embracing complexity’ suggests we should be doing.



How to read this book



In order to try to bring the contextual uniqueness of complexity to the fore, this book is written not in chapters, but in the form of short essays, which I refer to as ‘pieces’. I want to bring alive the concepts embedded in complexity and offer perspectives that might engage your imagination, evoke your determination, and cause you to question your beliefs and motivations. I don’t just want to explain concepts or provide methods. These pieces aim to be dialogic. You are invited to disagree, consider what is missing, maybe become energised, annoyed, amused or thoughtful, touched or piqued. I want to say to you – look, the world really is complex! How does that show itself in different contexts? What does it mean to you to say the world is complex, what do you think we should do differently? What should you do?

For this reason, I did not set out to write a primer or a textbook nor aim to be com-prehensive.18 I have wanted to allow myself to be inspired by chance encounters, be energised by what I read or by what comes up in conversation. I have wanted to write in a way that offers up a situational, relational take on complexity and brings it alive. My fear has been, if I were to overly sanitise this work, would I leave out the very nu-ances that matter? You will thus find examples from my own experience showing up in this writing. And you will find that many of the examples are UK-based, as that is where I live.

It also occurred to me that the Dao de Jing, the Daoist book that has entranced me for decades, is also written in this way – short, paradoxical, overlapping, often ambiguous chapters – poetic, mysterious, visceral, allegorical – and sometimes clear, angry, chal-lenging. Its chapters invite you to wrestle with them, respond to the feelings evoked, circle around, gain or lose clarity and let meaning and any implications for practice sur-face. I have gone back to these chapters in the Dao de Jing many times, over decades, and I always see new things and gain some deeper realisation. My writing is not so po-etic, and, I hope, less ambiguous – but it is from the Dao that I draw my inspiration for its form.

I am invoking in this approach the idea of the ‘slow read’ movement.19 These pieces are designed to be approached slowly, picked up and put down, digested and considered. Methods, principles that shape action, and suggestions for practice are there – but emerge in many cases through the medium of stories. There are no checklists and few summaries.

xxiv Introduction



I hope that engaging with these vignettes and examples engenders in you a shift in per-spective, an evaluation and potential reframing of your worldview. I hope they subtly change your mind. Cliff Bowman once said to me, somewhat inelegantly, that complex-ity is like a virus – once you are infected, you can’t get rid of it. There is no going back; you see things differently. There are few explicitly complex methods, but with com-plexity in mind, we may use common tools and methods in a different way and con-clude that some may be more useful than others. But there are methods: how do you find the simplicity on the other side of complexity? How do you get a sense of the whole and spot nascent signs of change? How do you attune to the flow and yet act to make a difference? The methods, though, tend to be contingent and suggestive, and each step towards clarity can tend to offer up more questions. Indeed, finding better questions is arguably an important method.

The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in conscious-

ness, an intuition or what you will, the solution comes to you, and you don’t know how

or why … I stop thinking, swim in silence, and the truth comes to me. Einstein

So, with the second half of the book in particular, there is an invitation to dip in, to reflect, to let the ideas seep in, irritate or inspire; there is no need to read it in order and no need to read it all.

I recommend a slightly different approach to the ‘first half’. Section I, The Long Walk to Freedom, develops the shift in science from determinism to indeterminism in a fairly systematic way. You may choose to read this section later, as it is not an easy read, but it probably works best to read it through starting at the beginning. I did in the end banish two particularly dense pieces – on indeterminism and quantum physics – to the Appendix.

Regarding Process Complexity, I would suggest you read the first four pieces before heading off more randomly. The sections on Daoism, Other Resonant Perspectives and Experiential Knowing don’t need such a systematic approach.

Before you dive into each section, it would also be beneficial to read their introduc-tions to in order to get a flavour of what they cover.

In general, though, I invite you to browse, read that which attracts you, circle in and around. Attend to your emotional reactions, notice what memories are provoked, read and absorb through your own lens and experience. Converse with it through other texts and ideas. Let yourself be critical and reflective and yet sometimes let the words permeate, not fully digested. Notice your feelings and reactions but don’t always try to make sense of them. You may sometimes weave insights and at other times just feel uncomfortable or heartily disagree. Working with the pieces in such a manner also re-flects the indeterminate paradoxical quality of life that process complexity, as well as Daoism, can show us. Perhaps we can creep up on complexity, dialogue with it, tus-sle with it as it weaves between our inner and outer worlds. Maybe we will discover a sense of its import and value as we go.

Introduction xxv



One further thought: In the section on experiential knowing, I make the point that knowing and meaning making are often best approached through working dia-logically with multiple perspectives. Suggest The Dao of Complexity to your study group, as readers may pick up on different aspects and interpret what they read in different ways. Group discussion can both surface what I was trying to say and what I might have said instead!

Housekeeping: I employ a number of concepts – for example, emergence, pattern, self-organisation, lock-in – and they occur in many places throughout the text. I have included a Glossary of terms at the end of the book. I have also indicated, in the text, where I have covered an idea from a different angle in another part of the book. Such cross-references are indicated by including, in square brackets, the number of the relevant piece.



Why did I write this book?



I am a theoretical physicist by background. My field of study was quantum physics. I then moved through various random steps, and through further academic study, into applied physics, strategy and organisational consultancy, lecturing in business schools and hands-on management until I finally emerged in the social sciences. When it comes to complexity theory, I feel reasonably equipped to bridge the gap between hard and soft sciences and between theory and practice.

My motivation comes from my anxiety about the state of the world. I feel enormously concerned about the insufficient focus on global heating, rising inequality and increase in global conflict. We seem to be ‘fiddling while Rome burns’. Indeed, we seem to be losing our humanity. I notice in business and politics a move away from the values of community, a lack of importance placed on integrity and truth, an unassailable focus on profit and on the short term, and a seeming unconcern about the precariousness of the future. In my lifetime, I have never been so concerned. This book, then, is my form of activism. It is written in the hope that it changes minds about how to act, manage, and consider the future, how to value others, value nature and see that we are all in this together. But is written in an open way. I am not insisting you share my values; I am inviting you to consider that our values drive our actions, and through our actions, we co-create the future.



It takes a village to raise a book



This book might have been conceived by me, but it has developed through all the con-versations I have had along the way. It has been nudged, challenged and re-formed through discourse; it has matured through the engagement with the ‘village’. This has sometimes led me into despondency as I peered through the holes in my thinking xxvi Introduction



and the gaps in my knowledge. But I cheered up when one colleague, Sharon Varney, pointed out that the universe is full of holes and that is what makes it work. I am not presenting you with a tidied-up coherent ‘whole’; holes and gaps invite you in.

There is a crack in everything, that is where the light gets in. Leonard Cohen

These dialogues with colleagues have been very fruitful and absolutely central to what this book has become. There are very many people to whom I owe heartfelt thanks – for robust conversations, suggestions, challenges and sometimes just cups of tea and encouragement.

I particularly want to mention ….

Zoe Arden, David Bent, Charles Boulton, Cliff Bowman, Mike Collins, Joanna Crowson, Greg Fisher, Margaret Gearty, Esther Maughan-McLachlan, Uschi May, Chris Mowles, Peter Reason, Rika Preiser, Fern Smith, Sharon Varney and Sam Woolley.

In 2015, Melissa Hawkins, Chris James and I set up a Complexity Interest Group at the University of Bath. This has gradually morphed into an online bi-monthly meeting with participants from across the globe. I would like to thank all the members of that group for sharing experiences from so many different spheres, and for all the interesting and challenging debates.

I started working on this book in 2019 during my research fellowship with the Stellen-bosch Institute of Advanced Study. I am very grateful for that time – the joy of engag-ing with scholars from many disciplines and geographies, and the space to research, reflect and write.

Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to Steve Hardman and Jaya Dalal of De Gruyter who have been an absolute pleasure to work with.



The artwork



I want to give particular mention to the artwork in the book. Putting together these twenty-five illustrations has been a journey in itself. You will see that the sketches and paintings evoke aspects of a processual worldview – but indirectly, aiming to engender a visceral rather than an intellectual reaction. There are flowing rivers, and precarious mountain ridges, weeds growing out of cracks in abandoned factories, piles of shoes and paths worn by use. They convey, variously, the sense of life’s journey – in the feet of an old woman, the way something new emerges in the most derelict of situations, the flow and emotional impact of history and change.

In particular, I have worked closely with Simon Blakeman, and we evolved a way of working through finding photographs that captured the essence of what I was trying to convey, which he used as a base. It was a form of dialogue and cooperative endeavour that was complex in itself. He needed to be inspired by my words and intentions but

Introduction xxvii



also be free to find his own artistic expression. I needed to find ways to express what I was seeing in the photos. Sometimes I just found art from other sources that fitted the ‘feeling sense’ of what I was after. I include pieces from a Ukrainian artist and one from a Palestinian artist who, as I write, is living with his family in a tent in Gaza. I list the artwork and the artists at the end of the book.



Ode ’ere



The Yorkshire folks were in a dither

Because of Heraclitus’ river

They knew they could not cross it twice

But were not clear – would once suffice?



And then at last a quite astute ’un

Remembered dear old Isaac Newton

Who was a marvel in his season.

And never was he contradicted,

He said that all could be predicted

And we could all rely on Reason.



And so, they dropped all their ferment

And settled on Enlightenment.

And all would have continued charmin’

Apart from that annoying Darwin

And his ideas of Evolution –

For which, it seems there’s no solution.



This led to quite a sense of urgenc-

Y – and focus on Emergence;

The physicists tried to ignore it

Those rich economists deplored it,

And Management was not too keen …



But then into this sorry scene

Came Russian Belgian Prigogine

Who said ‘Don’t fear, science isn’t broken

‘Cos things thought closed are in truth open;

There is a theory quite supreme

Which fits experience like a dream.’



The Yorkshire folk who’d felt at sea

Poured yet another cup of tea

And marvelled at Complexity.



—Jean Boulton, 2009





Section I




The Long Walk to Freedom:

the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview





1


Introducing the long walk to freedom1



Why physics, when applied to the actual messiness of the universe, paints a much more

complex picture than we might expect. And why this is important, given the tendency to

adopt physics theories to explain and manage the social and natural world.



In this section, I start with Isaac Newton’s theories of gravity, out of which emerged the mechanical worldview. This presents a picture of a universe obeying over-

arching universal laws and unfolding to plan. I explore the reasons why this scientific worldview has been superseded. I explain how Charles Darwin’s theories of evolution sparked interest amongst physicists as well as philosophers and how this led to the view of an evolving, contextual, indeterminate universe – a universe of richness, free-dom and novelty.

Before I embark on this journey, I focus in the first piece, ‘Metaphysics and chocolate’ [2], on a discussion of the meaning and importance of words like metaphysics and worldview.



Worldviews



Much of this book is about the implications of the world being complex. It explores the way we understand ourselves as individuals, the way we view organisational life, and engage with big global issues such as economics, politics and climate change. It considers how we gain knowledge and how that shapes our actions, both individually and as part of institutions. But what drives all of this?

The enduring theme to which I constantly return is that it is our worldviews that are fundamental to shaping how we think, what we deem as important, and what we then do. Without addressing our implicit assumptions and beliefs, nothing really changes. We merely try and do better at what we were already doing. So, one of the purposes of this particular section is to explore, unpick and challenge scientific assumptions about ‘the way things work’.

The chance of surviving with dignity on this planet hinges on the acquisition of a new

mind. F. J. Varela2



I think the language that pertains to this broad notion of the way things work is quite tricky to navigate, and in ‘Metaphysics and chocolate’ [2], I describe the concepts that circle around all of this – ontology, metaphysics, worldview, cosmology – and try to get to the nub of it all. I am not introducing a complexity perspective at this stage; I am seeking to lay the ground as to what these philosophical concepts are concerned with, 4 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



and why asking ourselves about our own often opaque and taken-for-granted assump-tions and beliefs is so important.



Science and the nature of the universe



The second focus of this section is to endeavour to show that the physical sciences, despite being made up of lots of laws, do not actually infer that the universe works like a predictable machine. The physical sciences are not painting a picture of a universe proceeding in an orderly fashion – and this is for all sorts of reasons that I will explore. I believe it is really important to debunk the mechanical worldview encapsulated by: things work to plan, like a machine, and science supports this.



Walras and equilibrium physics

Léon Walras, in 1874, expressed the view, that “this pure theory of economics is a

science which resembles the physico-mathematical sciences in every respect.”3 This

is a very strong assertion and Edward Fulbrook had this to say:

What matters to … Walras is not the methodological fit but rather the method itself. …Instead of being led by ontological inquiry [he] defines a priori the ontol-ogy to fit the method. Nothing could have been more against the procedures and mindset that have dominated the natural sciences from Copernicus on. … For a scientist … the mathematics is supposed to illuminate empirical reality, rather than

the other way around.4

In other words, Walras merely asserted, with a paucity of exploration or evidence,

that the mathematics of classical physics (in this case that pertaining to equilibrium

thermodynamics) would be a good fit for economics and hence that would make

economics ‘scientific’. Joseph Stiglitz calls this “a triumph of ideology over science”.5

These days it would be called scientism.6



Science tends to be regarded as the gold standard of thinking and concepts, and models from physics in particular are often adopted by those seeking to understand the social and natural world. But if these models and worldviews are inappropriate to the situa-tion, we run the risk of choosing actions and policies that do not give us what we want. They might lead to strategies that are ineffective or, worse, are actually harmful for the future – think climate change, increasing inequality, political polarisation, and loss of resilience. Underneath policy and strategy, a ‘classical’ scientific worldview often lurks.

Most of the pieces in this section address physics, arguably the most fundamental of sciences. People in all sorts of ways love to quote physics and use it as a justification for all manner of schools of thought. Social scientists, for example, are wont to look to quantum physics to re-imagine new approaches and this can be a great thing provided there is a differentiation between metaphor and actuality. And the mainstream of eco-nomics and management theory is still based on classical physics; the economists still

1 Introducing the long walk to freedom 5



like to build on the idea of balance and equilibrium, and the management people con-tinue to love a good machine metaphor.

So, it feels to me that because ‘science says this’ is such a powerful argument, it is im-portant to try and unpick as much as possible what science does say. This is the key motivation for writing this section, which takes the long walk from the ticking clock [3], iron block [5] view of Newtonian physics, to the freedom [8] entailed in the science of open systems. The science of open systems is what led to complexity science.

This temptation of certainty is the solidification of self against other, of delimitation

of national boundaries in opposition to other human societies, in brief, the source of

suffering. My hope is that if modern science can rediscover in its own way this profound

truth, then the ears of our contemporaries will be more open and receptive because of

the authority that science carries in our Western world. Varela7

Has this not been tackled elsewhere? My feeling is that popular science texts are often more focused on explaining to non-scientists the sexy bits of pure physics rather than explaining the way many different aspects of physics weave together when acting on the messy non-uniform clouds of dust and energy and ‘stuff’.8 And yet it is this ‘woven- together’ perspective that is most likely to have relevance for our understanding of the messy open complex social and natural world ‘down here’.

Some scientists are more focused on the wider complex picture and its metaphysical meanings. My heroes are Roger Penrose, Carlo Rovelli, Martin Rees, Lee Smolin, Stuart Kauffman, Chris Clarke and Ilya Prigogine. Interestingly and perhaps not surprisingly, many of them, as did Einstein, also ponder the human condition, comment on social and world events, flirt with things spiritual, and see themselves as global citizens with a responsibility to play their part. They are aware of the power of science to shape narratives and for science potentially to be misleading when taken outside of its remit.

A human being experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separate

from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of

prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons

nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our

circle of compassion to embrace all living creature and the whole of nature in its

beauty. Einstein



So, my endeavour in this section is to make plain the various and varying ontological assumptions embedded, over its history, within the physical sciences, and discuss their limitations exposed by later theories and through experimental evidence. In particular, I want to examine the ‘mechanical worldview’ that emerged from Newton’s science, challenge the assumptions on which it is built and expose its weaknesses. This world-view still holds enormous power and sway in the world of policy development and management. But it is not scientific to adopt a view from outdated science. And it is not scientific to apply it to a problem which is outside the remit for which it was developed. 6 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



Furthermore, I believe that if we continue to act as if the world operates like a machine, it will severely impede our ability to find solutions to the developing crises of our time.

I spotted Rovelli had written this, at the end of his Seven Brief Lessons on Physics:

I believe that our species will not last long. … The brutal climate and environmental

changes which we have triggered are unlikely to spare us. For the earth they may turn

out to be a small irrelevant blip, but I do not think that we will outlast them unscathed. …

I fear that soon we shall also have to become the only species that will knowingly watch

the coming of its own collective demise, or at least the demise of its civilisation.9



Rovelli uses strong words. My hope in writing this section is to show that if we start to think differently about ‘the way the world works’, if we challenge our scientific world-views, we might see things differently and do a better job of engendering a sustainable future. Gripping an inappropriate scientific worldview is not the only reason why we continue to behave as if the present will continue indefinitely. But it is an important reason; it is used as a powerful justification, a comfortable sop for us to continue on our fateful path. There is still hope if we are willing to ‘change our minds’.



Content of this section



Below is a list of the pieces in this section, with a brief description of what they are about.



• Metaphysics and chocolate



Exploring the vocabulary that focuses on ‘the way things are’, contrasting this with ‘the way we know about the way things are’ and suggesting why this is important. Our scientific worldviews matter.



• The ticking clock



Explaining why the mechanical worldview, that bastion of science coming from Newton, was built on shaky ground, and relied on God to sort out the difficult bits.



• The indeterminate universe



Summarising two longer pieces, now banished to an Appendix, which list reasons why the universe is not deterministic, but is full of holes, discontinuities, messiness and paradox. How these features offer the potential for an ever-changing, ever-forming, impossible to predict complex connecting cosmos.

1 Introducing the long walk to freedom 7



• Unity and uniqueness

Unpicking our predisposition to adopt over-arching maxims that apply universally. How early scientists believed they were revealing the mind of God and His ability to have an oversight of past, present and future all at the same time. And how this con-nects with seeking absolutes in qualities such as Beauty, Truth, Purpose or Oneness. Exploring the flaws in this reasoning.



• Is there no thing?



Showing how theories of physics gradually do away with ‘things’ altogether, and how this paves the way for conceiving of a world of ‘processes’.



• Darwin and evolution



How Darwin changed the game for science, philosophy, economics and even literature and showed that, without messiness and uncertainty, nothing changes.



• Messiness is next to openness



How Prigogine focused on open systems, connected it to evolutionary theory, got the Nobel prize for so doing and established the foundations of complexity theory.

In summary



This section, mainly on science, is not easy. You may not want to start with this section of the book, and it won’t appeal to everyone. The aim is to ground subsequent discussions on complexity in its historical scientific context and really try to bury the ‘science tells us the future unfolds to plan’ argument. What we believe has such an impact on what we do.

I do suggest, if you read it, that you start at the beginning and read through; the pieces are designed to build on each other. The complex explanations of quantum physics [73] and a detailed view of what creates indeterminism [72] are now safely hidden away in the Appendix but are there if you are interested.

In a nutshell, I am arguing, in this section, that physics does not paint a picture of a world working like a machine. Rather, it offers a picture of a world that depends on context and history, has a level of variation and messiness without which little would happen, has an intrinsic level of uncertainty that cannot be removed – and gives room for mystery, novelty, and emergence. This paves the way nicely for the beginnings of complexity theory, which is where I end this section.

Metaphysics and chocolate



How our beliefs about ‘the nature of things’ fundamentally shape how we investigate and

learn, and also impact what actions we take.

The more I learn of physics, the more I am drawn to metaphysics. Einstein

There is no metaphysics on earth like chocolate. Fernando Pessoa



As early as my teens, I mused about the nature of reality, including the question as to whether there is a reality. This was amplified by my study of physics. It hasn’t translated for me into a search for a universal tidy theory that explains everything. Rather, I have been intrigued by how change happens, how the very big relates to the very small, and about the mystery of beginnings (was there a beginning – just one – at a particular time and place – why?) and endings.

These are scientific but also philosophical preoccupations, and I eventually came to understand this as a metaphysical or ontological quest. I became interested in how my view of ‘reality’ affects how I think about life in general and my own life. Am I stepping into a flowing river of life, or am I just an individual with my own particular history and make-up, muddling along? Is the spiritual, whatever that means, separate from the material, whatever that means – or not? How do I make sense of intuitions or synchronicities? Why do I feel so passionately about certain things, so drawn in? Why have certain questions stayed with me all my life?

Have patience with all that is unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions

themselves, like closed rooms, like books written in a foreign tongue. … Live the ques-

tions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing, one day in the future, live

into the answers. Rainer Maria Rilke10

The terms that span this terrain – ontology, metaphysics, cosmology, worldview – are not, I find, easy to pin down. But I am not too concerned here with crystallising definitions; rather, I want to show that all these concepts share a common interest in asking how the universe and everything in it exists, changes, connects and so on. My focus is on exploring the nature of reality, the nature of being, the way things are – all slightly different expressions but homing in on the same territory. I am trying to explore whether there are fundamental principles that underpin the nature of things at many scales – principles that might hold true for universes, galaxies, societies, ecol-ogies and even brains. Is that a step too far, or is there something to be reached for? What do we find when we explore different philosophical and scientific perspectives, and different types of experiential evidence? Are there common features and if so, how can we express them?

10 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



Definitions

Ontology is concerned with the nature of things, the so-called nature of being.11 Onto-

logy can embrace universal big picture concerns but can also be used to explore more

specific situations.12

The notion of worldview can contain our ideas about the nature of being but also in-

clude our over-arching views and beliefs more generally – on ethics, gender or religion,

for example.

Cosmology has, in fact, related but different meanings in philosophy and in science. In

philosophy, it encompasses the philosophical contemplation of the universe as a totality.

In physics, cosmology is limited to the scientific study of the material universe – its struc-

ture, origins and future development.

So, as is evident, there is some overlap and also certain differences of emphasis when

it comes to defining these terms and grappling with what they are seeking to convey.

These questions about the nature of things are also deemed to be metaphysical. Meta-

physics conveys a more over-arching, a ‘grander’ perspective than ontology. But, as

well as considering the nature of reality, metaphysics also covers more human-centred

concerns such as: what is knowledge, what is consciousness, what is the role of human

perception?



It is interesting to note that metaphysics went out of fashion as our modern world placed such emphasis on evidence and reason, and objective ‘hard science’. It was seen as unfounded speculation. But it is gaining importance once more.13 Rovelli argues that metaphysics often inspires and opens up the vista for scientists to explore.14

The imagination often leads where reason cannot, as reason is often constrained by the

scientific norms of the time. Rovelli15

There is also an argument for seeking to develop metaphysical perspectives through empirical means, bottom-up – a form of naturalistic metaphysics.16 This is an approach with which I would concur; it also underpins Daoist thinking. As I explore in ‘Unity and uniqueness’ [5], Daoists disavow over-arching universal concepts. Their metaphysics is more focused on the contextual and the particular – gleaned through experience rather than through grand analysis and logic. Consider this snippet from the Dao de Jing:

The events of the world arise from the determinate

And the determinate arises from the indeterminate.17

This snippet captures the essence of Daoist cosmology, as I will go on to explore, and reminds me of the idea of Order out of Chaos,18 the title of one of Prigogine’s books.

I really believe this is important stuff. How we think about the nature of reality has such an impact on what we see as salient, how we interpret our experience, and what

2 Metaphysics and chocolate 11



we include in our scientific experiments and explorations. If, for example, we think that the universe is deterministic, that it follows a set path, then why tackle climate change or inequality if they are pre-determined? If we think that the future is entirely determined by fixed laws, then why bother to explore local contexts or histories? If the universe is understandable – at least in principle – by reason alone, then why give any value to intuitions or subjective experience – or even dare to imagine that the inter-actions between aspects of the universe are less than objectively existent and may in actuality be fuzzy and paradoxical?

Getting the right term (ontology or cosmology or whatever) and pinning down its meaning is not crucial. These are ideas to wrestle with and let any meanings seep in. Every time I go around this loop, I gain a richer understanding of the territory these concepts are staking out. It is taking seriously the territory that is important.



Ontology, epistemology and methodology



Thus far, I have primarily focused on the language and concepts that dance around the ontological/metaphysical question as to ‘how things are’. There is a related, epistemo-logical question, which is to ask: ‘how do we get to know about how things are’?

Our ontological stance – how we view the nature of things, how we view the way things stabilise or change – needs to be linked to our epistemological stance – what knowledge we deem important, and how best to gain access to this knowledge.

To give an example: If we think that the social world behaves rather like a machine and can be considered stable and connected by well-defined forces, then it makes sense to investigate that world through measuring the strength of those forces and measuring the connection between outputs and inputs. However, if we think the social world is more organic – more like a pond or a wood than a machine – then we may feel we need to explore ‘webs of interdependence’ and be more cognisant of local conditions, rather than look for simple interactions between unchanging things.

The link between how we theorise about the nature of the world (our ontology) and how we believe we can know about it (our epistemology) leads to the methodological question as to how we then choose to investigate it, and how we then choose to act. These need to be self-consistent; otherwise, we risk missing the very information that is key to furthering our understanding.

So, if the world is complex, then choosing methods of investigation that ignore or slide over that complexity is unlikely to surface the very features that may be key to under-standing what is happening. This is a point I return to many times [27] [41] [56].

This then sets the stage, for exploring, in what follows, the ontology of complexity and its implications. Viewing the world as complex, uncertain and emergent (a complexity ontology), rather than objective, predictable and controllable (a mechanistic onto logy), has a significant impact on how we choose ‘ways of knowing’ and how we subsequently work out what to do and how to do it.

12 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



Furthermore, our worldviews and ontological positions bias what we select as impor-tant to explore, what we notice, how we interpret what we notice, and what consequent actions we take [65].



What about the human?



I want to end on an important point, which concerns the role of the human in all this. Clearly, the universe as a whole got on pretty well for billions of years developing its trillions of galaxies, its planets, clouds and fields of energy, without human conscious-ness and in the absence of humans. Our human observing and engaging cannot be vital, as the universe, planet formation and emerging life were doing quite well without us.

I am thus wary of explanations that put too much emphasis on the role of the human observer [73].

To think that human beings, their minds, their tools or the numbers they use play any

special role in the [ontological] grammar of nature is nonsense. Rovelli19



The relationship between humans and everything else is just one relationship that is occurring in the universe. Indeed, the relational view of quantum physics suggests that ‘reality’ is ‘subjective to itself’ [73] and that properties are dependent on ‘what is interacting with what’ in the broadest sense. In other words, this quantum fluctuation is impacted by the interaction with that gravitational fluctuation and vice versa. One could say they ‘observe’ each other. This is an important notion to reflect on, as it pulls us away from seeing ourselves as somehow central. I further explore this topic – of relational quantum physics and ‘ontological subjectivity’ – in ‘Smoke and mirrors’ [73]. And I recommend Helgoland by Rovelli on this topic.20

Within the immense ocean of galaxies and stars we are in a remote corner … we are

merely a flourish among many such flourishes. Rovelli21



Secondly, for more prosaic reasons, it is unlikely that human thinking or even human experiencing could ever reveal all aspects of the universe. There are, no doubt, factors existent in the universe that are intrinsic to its functioning, but yet are beyond both our cognition and our physical apparatus to sense them. I cannot know these factors, but I can allow, in my musings, for their existence. And maybe they show themselves darkly, tangentially, in glimpses, in ways not expected. I may notice these glimpses if I am open to the possibility of their existence.

One thing I have learned in a long life; that all our science, measured against reality, is

primitive and childlike. We still do not know one thousandth of one per cent of what

nature has revealed to us. It is entirely possible that behind the perception of our

senses, worlds are hidden of which we are unaware. Albert Einstein

2 Metaphysics and chocolate 13



Since we are not the culmination of intelligence, we’ve got to be mindful that there

could be aspects of reality of which we are unaware, which our brains couldn’t grasp.

Martin Rees22



Having said all this, I do expect that any metaphysics that deals with the universe will still be relevant when humans are in the picture too. I am not separating us humans from everything else. Neither am I excluding our inner worlds. But I am working on the assumption that the nature of reality is not dependent on us, or shaped by us to any greater extent than it is shaped by any other type of interaction.

We are an integral part of the world … we are not external observers. … We are made

up of the same atoms and the same light signals as are exchanged between pine trees

in the forest and stars in the galaxies. Rovelli23

Lee Smolin, more generally, argues for not treating physics and biology as different in kind, because, as he says, living biological systems are made of the same stuff as rocks and clouds. He states: “An approach to physics that does not make the existence of life comprehensible must eventually give way to one that does.”24



In summary



This piece aims to provide a language and understanding concerning key concepts on which the rest of the book builds. There are four points to make by way of summary.

First, as I explained in the Introduction to the book, the starting point for this book is an ontological quest. This is an important point to emphasise, as many approaches to complexity are less focused on teasing out the nature of reality and more interested in methods. As Ron Martin and Peter Sunley point out: “In complexity theory, epistemo-logy has dominated over ontology.”25 So, I hope the discussion here – if you’re not al-ready steeped in these philosophical concepts – has put some ‘flesh on the bones’ of notions of metaphysics, cosmology, ontology and so on, as these terms will come up many times in future sections.

Second – and this is a recurring theme in the book – beliefs matter. What we believe about all sorts of things – including our ontological views of the nature of reality or the nature of change – drives everything that follows. As I argue in ‘It’s only make believe’ [65], without surfacing and exploring our beliefs, nothing substantive really alters.

Thirdly, how we view the nature of things – whether or not we think the world is com-plex and what that means – will drive how we think we can explore that world (our epistemology) and what we do. In Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World and in ‘The raw and the cooked’ [31], I take up this issue of epistemology.

Finally, a good science should apply to humans as part of everything, but a science that relies on human interaction for its framing should be viewed with suspicion.

The ticking clock



Why the universe does not work like a machine and why Isaac Newton had not discovered a

‘theory of everything’.



The machine worldview – the idea that “nature works according to mechanical laws” and that “everything in the material world can be explained in terms of the arrange-ment and movement of its parts” – was first proposed by René Descartes and then built on by Newton.26 Science has moved on from this view, but its power in the world of organisations and management is still very evident. In this piece, I want to illustrate its limitations and show, as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz27 pointed out at the time, that it cannot account for the diverse, rich, evolving structure of the universe.

The mechanical worldview, articulated by Descartes, was brought to life through Newton’s calculations as to how the planets in the solar system move around the sun. Until that point, others had tried to get the maths to work by assuming that the earth was the centre. Indeed Galileo Galilei, in 1633, was condemned for heresy, and put under house arrest until his death in 1642 for daring to suggest that it was the sun around which the planets revolved. It was Newton who showed, in 1686, that the mathematical equations become elegantly simple when the sun is placed in the centre. It was a huge step forwards and indeed loosened the power of the church to dominate philosophical thinking and strangle this new field of science.



The mechanical worldview

The mechanical worldview, applied to the social world, assumes that things interact in

a consistent, predictable fashion, like a machine of interacting parts that behaves like

clockwork. The progress over time of a mechanical system, such as a ticking clock, can

be predicted. Causes and effects derive from simple, linear interactions between things

and can be traced. Outcomes are measurable and can be attributed to inputs. Differ-

ent aspects of the situation – for example, the social and the environmental – can be

handled independently, and projects and organisations can be divided into separate

independent parts. There is no possibility, however, of learning or change, of anything

new entering the system or anything leaving the system. If organisations truly were me-

chanical, there would be no possibility of innovation, learning or adaptation.



Newton’s theories, on which the mechanical worldview is based, are deterministic. That is to say, if we know everything at a particular point, we can know everything that hap-pens before or after. They are also reductive – it is assumed that an interaction between two things is unaffected by anything else, present or past. These are simplifications and later science shows that things are not so uncomplicated. Nevertheless, Newton’s science allowed, to an astonishingly accurate degree, the mapping of the planets and trajectories around the sun. And for many people, ever since, the mechanical 16 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



worldview has epitomised what science is – a search for certainty, for clear causal relationships between elements of the situation, for objectivity, for universal laws and for predictable outcomes.

At the time, it caught the imagination of many – including the natural philosopher and mathematician Emilie du Châtelet.28 She translated the Principia Mathematica, Newton’s great work, from Latin into French. She and her lover Voltaire felt this had great relevance for the social world and it fuelled their vision of being able to design and build a new society that would operate like a well-oiled machine. This idea contributed to the naissance of the French Enlightenment with its focus on reason – the idea that reason, with its logical, objective, analytical standpoint, can uncover everything important and can stand against unprovable doctrines, superstitions or unreliable emotional whims. Newton lived at the beginning of the Modern period – where religion and science, reason and emotion, body and mind were seen as separate things, each with its own sphere.

It has been the rationalist, plausible, and apparently logical argument of the French

tradition, with its flattering assumptions about the unlimited powers of human reason,

which has progressively gained influence. Friedrich Hayek29



This then is the mechanical worldview. It revolutionised science at the time and also underpinned the French Enlightenment. It continues to have a massive impact on methods of management.



So, what is wrong with the mechanical worldview?



Were Newton’s theories as comprehensive as we might imagine? As I will explore, Newton’s theories cannot explain the structure, particularity and the path-dependent irreversibility of the universe. They also rely on God to play a part.



(1) God had to set off the clockwork universe in order for it to behave

like clockwork



What is not immediately obvious is that Newton’s theories have no way of incorporat-ing a beginning, a creation – or indeed an ending. Motion just goes on forever. Secondly, for his theories to apply to the universe as a whole, and hence to form the basis of a cosmology, he needed a frame of reference in which to place the universe – something that oriented the universe in a context wider than it, a sort of notional box in which the universe sat, against which he could define left or right, or up and down. As cosmologist Lee Smolin discusses in The Life of the Cosmos:

The problem of how to make a theory of a whole universe is the problem of how to

construct a theory without making any reference to anything … outside of the system

we are describing. Newton’s physics … relied heavily on the use of a fixed background

and for this reason, could never have stood as a theory of the whole universe.30

3 The ticking clock 17



Smolin continues: “One cannot speak of where the universe is, or when it happened … the only reference points available to describe when or where something happens are other events.”31

These assumptions of a ‘time zero’ and of an absolute spatial framework in which things happen are axiomatic;32 they have to be assumed and cannot be proven. Newton solved this by calling upon God to orient the universe and set it off. In other words, Newton’s classical mechanics, in order to apply it as a universal theory, depended on assertions about what God would do.

When challenged on these axiomatic assumptions at the time by Leibniz, Newton replied that God decided – on when the universe started, on which way up it is. When Leibniz asked how this would change if God had set off the universe half an hour later, or further to the left, Newton merely replied that that was for God to choose.33

The point of sharing this story is to emphasise that what is regarded as the most scienti-fic and rational of sciences, the standard for all other scientific endeavours, is based on non-obvious axiomatic assumptions (attributed by Newton to what God did) without which the theory becomes much more limited and much less of a contender for a universal ‘theory of everything’.

(2) Particularity and patterning



Although Newton’s laws allow, to a good approximation, the mapping of the motions of the planets around the sun, they only explain some of the phenomena of the universe. They cannot explain for example why the solar system is flat, or the particularity of the detail of the universe – the specificity of each galaxy, planet and meteor shower. The universe is not uniform; every piece has its own uniqueness, its own history. Leibniz pointed out that Newton’s theories have nothing to say about this patterning of the universe.34 Leibniz described this as the “order of coexistences” giving rise to the struc-tures of galaxies and planets.

The fact that we live in a universe of structures at so many scales is so commonplace, so

manifest, that it is easy to miss its significance. Smolin35

I hold space to be something merely relative ... an order of coexistences. Leibniz36



(3) Irreversibility and path dependence



Finally, a machine-like universe would not only be entirely predictable but would also be reversible. If things are reversible, you can’t tell the difference between the past and the future. The passage of time has no discernible impact, leaves no trace. This provides one more nail in the coffin of the machine perspective. In practice, things change irreversibly. Things grow, age and die; new things emerge. There is no possibility of smoothly going back, no retracing of steps; things never exactly repeat. Stars are born and eventually use up all their fuel and die. Flora and fauna evolve, many become 18 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



extinct, and others take their place. If we watched a time lapse film of a forest or a drama on the television, it would be entirely obvious if it were played backwards.

As Prigogine said, time’s irreversibility is a “fundamental aspect of the universe”.37

This irreversible process is also path dependent. Structures of galaxies, stars, meteor clouds, and energy fields are constantly changing. What happens next is shaped by what already exists, coupled with the influence of the longer-range interactions with other galaxies and structures.



What does this mean for the world of management?



Newton’s physics was without doubt an amazing achievement. It brought clarity to certain aspects of dynamics of the universe (gravity), but it cannot explain many others. Since then, the mathematics has been challenged and extended by quantum physics and relativity, and it no longer stands as ‘good science’ in its own terms, for the problems for which it was derived.

Nevertheless, this mechanical worldview – of prediction and certainty – still forms the basis of many management practices and still forms the gold standard for what we think science can offer. And yet it is clear that social systems do not behave in this fashion. And if they did, if the future really were that predictable, there would be no newness and no potential for adaptation. Machines can’t change, they can merely chug along.

We [modern scientists] have arrived very far from the mechanical world of Newton

and Laplace, where minute cold stones eternally travelled on long precise trajectories

in geometrically immutable space. Rovelli38

Mock on, mock on Voltaire Rousseau

Mock on mock on, tis all in vain!

You throw the sand against the wind

And the wind blows it back again. William Blake



The extent to which Newton’s science still dominates approaches to management seems rather astonishing. In Section VII, Perspectives on Organisational Practice, I share many examples of where this view continues to prevail – often to the detriment of achieving what was intended.

The indeterminate universe



What causes indeterminacy in the universe?



Newton made a remarkable contribution to science. His work on gravity and mechanics was of enormous importance. But in practice gravity is not the only

factor driving the universe. There are light, heat, sound, electricity and magnetism. And eventually scientists discovered nuclear forces and quantum mechanics. Like Newton’s theories, many of these theories are also deterministic, so, it does beg the question as to whether the universe could be deterministic – still a machine, just a more complicated one than envisaged by Newton.

In the Appendix, I have included quite a detailed breakdown of what causes the uni-verse not to work like a machine. There are two pieces: ‘Science and indeterminism’ [72] and ‘Smoke and mirrors’ [73], which is an exploration of quantum physics. In case you don’t wish to tackle them, I summarise the key points here.

The same dull round, even of a universe, would soon become a mill with complicated

wheels. Blake

Messiness: Even if the laws of physics are deterministic, they operate on messy stuff. We don’t really know much about the Big Bang, including whether there was only one of them, or a series of them, or whether it happened somewhere or everywhere. But the cosmic microwave background39 shows that its aftermath was not uniform. This non-uniformity may have been the result of the remains of a previous universe,40 or due to quantum fluctuations or heat fluctuations [72] or, more likely, all of these.

A second after the Big Bang, nothing in the laws of particle physics hinted at the possi-

bility of rivers, misty dawns, or human beings. These only became possible as more and

more constraints piled onto the initial soup of particles. Karl Schroeder41



Indeed, had there been uniformity, there would not have been the clumping of energy and matter that concentrates things sufficiently for stars to be born. The emergence and evolution of stars and galaxies in all their glory fundamentally depends on non- uniformity, on messiness.

Another source of indeterminacy: These messy clouds of energy are subject to the pushes and pulls of different ‘forces’. These forces – nuclear, magnetic, gravitational – cannot be considered merely additive. They operate together in complex ways.



20 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



Star birth

Stars are created from turbulence and vortices in clouds of simple molecules. Some

patches need to be dense enough for gravity to create enough force for nuclear

reactions to occur. In addition, the clouds tend to be strongly magnetic, and this resists

gravity, meaning that more material is needed before there is a collapse into star forma-

tion. The particularity of the shape and size of a molecular cloud and the exact timing

of other matter arriving from the wider universe will shape what sort of star is formed.

And when there are births and explosions leading to the formation of new heavier el-

ements, these events are complex. Scientists have an understanding of the conditions

under which stars can form – but being able to predict when, how and into what a par-

ticular situation might lead to is another matter.



Closed systems and continuity: Newton’s theories and other deterministic theories apply to closed systems. These theories can’t deal with and don’t apply to beginnings, endings and discontinuities.

And evidence shows that the universe is full of discontinuities – black holes and various sorts of ‘tears in the fabric’.

Clarke describes quantum theory as “a crack in the notion of perfection”, and he regards the crack as “the most beautiful element in the whole picture”.42 Leonard Cohen take note!

Thus, we can’t think of space as continuous. And indeed, as Einstein showed, we can’t even think space as being distinct from matter.

Quantum physics messes up everything ontologically: Quantum physics also changes the game when it comes to determinism. As I describe in more detail in ‘Smoke and mirrors’ [73], properties are held in the relationship between things, not in the things themselves. Properties are context dependent and paradoxical – showing different ‘faces’ depending on what is interacting with what.

Furthermore, quantum physics shows that there are really no ‘things’ anyway when it comes down to it, as I explore further in ‘Is there no thing at all?’ [6]. Quantum physics points to an ontological form of indeterminism. Go to the Appendix if you are interested.



So …



The universe shows its nature as path-dependent, context-sensitive, loosely inter-connected and evolving. And above all, it is indeterminate. It really doesn’t look like a machine. In this piece, I have listed some of the reasons why.





5




Unity and uniqueness



Why we assume that there are over-arching universal truths and why this is to be

questioned. An emergent view of imperfect, incoherent, self-organising wholeness.



In this piece, I want to explore a particular aspect of the machine worldview which centres on the concepts of Universality and Unity.



The iron block



Classical physics of Newton in the seventeenth century had its origins in theology. “Its aim”, Prigogine explained, “was to bring Man closer to the knowledge of God.” He continued: “For God, there is no difference between past, present and future. Everything is there, eternally.”43 Thus science, in the view of Newton, reveals itself in the form of time-independent, universal, unchanging laws – laws that mirror the mind of God [3]. As Toulmin says, “Descartes and Newton set out to build mathematical structures and looked to science for theological not technological dividends.”44

These top-down universal laws were deemed to apply everywhere and forever and give no opportunity for change or novelty. From this perspective, the universe, as dis-cussed in [3], is viewed as a gigantic deterministic machine where everything merely unfolds according to God’s plan. As William James says, Newton’s science conveys the “absolute unity” of an “iron block”.

To quote James more fully:

What does determinism profess? It professes that those parts of the universe already

laid down absolutely appoint and decree what the other parts shall be. The future has

no ambiguous possibilities hidden in its womb … the whole is in each and every part

and welds it with the rest into an absolute unity, an iron block, in which there can be no

equivocation or shadow of turning.45

Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always

similar and immovable. Newton



These universal laws had a further quality. As they were of God’s making, they were deemed to be ‘perfect’ in the sense that they provided the optimal universe that God could create.

The idea of Perfection is the subject of Plato’s ideal forms.46 Plato suggested that Man’s task was to overcome the chaos of our realm and strive for this Perfection. Indeed, this fuelled the idea, centuries later, of the Great Chain of Being in which each evolutionary 22 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



step – from amoeba to Man – was moving the animal realm closer to this Perfection, closer to God, with Man as its greatest expression.

This perpetual chain of causes and effects, whose first link is riveted to the throne of

God, divides itself into innumerable diverging branches, which, like the nerves arising

from the brain, permeate the most minute and most remote extremities of the system,

diffusing motion and sensation to the whole. … We trace the operations of nature from

cause to cause, climbing up the links of these chains of being, till we ascend to the Great

Source of all things. Erasmus Darwin47



This view of Perfection included qualities such as Goodness, Truth and Beauty. These absolute qualities were not deemed to change with circumstances, were not matters of perspective or context, but were of an eternal, ‘perfect’ nature.

What we now regard as universal laws prevailing throughout the observable universe

may, in the grander perspective of the multiverse, be just parochial bylaws applied to

our cosmic patch. Rees48



Daoism embraces uniqueness not Unity



Daoist philosophers David Hall and Roger Ames really brought home to me just how wedded we are in the West to the idea of Unity. As they say: “In classical Western metaphysics, the equivocation between unity and uniqueness has largely been re-solved in favour of unity.”49 In other words, we in the West, despite scientific evidence that brings into question whether the universe is entirely determined by over-arching laws, still have a predisposition for seeking universality.

To give an example of our predisposition for universality: In the field of management, we seek ‘best practice’ and are attracted to standardised solutions where ‘one size fits all’. We continue to see science as the territory of certainty and prediction, obeying fixed rules and continue to want to mimic that in managing the social world.

Complexity theory, as explored in Section II, presents a view of science as much more contextual, much more about uniqueness than Unity. In similar vein, as explored in Section III, the Daoist perspective starts with the particular and local and does not invoke assumptions of universality or unity. There is no “transcending pattern” that determines order. There is no “superordinate One to which the many reduce.”50 An over-arching Unity “would dominate the order of the parts.”51

In other words, what goes on here and now – the local order – is shaped by the particularities of the local conditions – those “particular elements that come together to make it” which are “unique and irreplaceable” and can’t be substituted without everything changing.52 Change even one thing and you change the local pattern. This is self-organisation shaped by local conditions [14].

5 Unity and uniqueness 23



Coherence and Unity – wholes but not a Whole



I want to bring in one more related theme into this section, and that is the idea of coherence. Coherence in science and mathematics refers to situations in which no information is lost as things unfold. There is perfect, unbroken connection. If you dropped a stone on a flat pond, the ripples would be coherent; if you viewed water from a bubbling stream, the ripples and swirls would not be coherent.

One example of coherence is a so-called standing wave pattern in sound vibrations.



Sound vibrations displayed with salt



You can create a ‘Chladni Plate’ by pouring

salt or sand onto a taut membrane.53 Play

music and watch the salt move, making

the vibration of sound waves visible to all.

You find patterns that transform with each

pitch change, forming a mesmerising visu-

al representation of standing waves that is

usually hidden from sight.54



If the universe were coherent, unbreakable or indivisible, then it would satisfy the con-ditions for determinacy. In practice, as discussed in ‘The indeterminate universe’ [4], the universe is full of holes and discontinuities and does not function as a coherent, indivisible Whole. Indeed, without discontinuities and messy asymmetries, we could not account for the forms and structures of which the universe is composed [4] [72].

Why am I labouring this point? According to Aristotle, the Platonists proffered an argument for the existence of Forms that was called the “One Over Many.”55 This is an idea that has attracted philosophers ever since. Some philosophers suggest that out of this Oneness can spring individuality and differentiable features (the Many). Freya Mathews, for example, asserts that the universe is “primordially an indivisible whole”56 and that the nature of space is a “vast, unbounded, unbroken, field-like continuum”.57 Yet within that “seamless whole” Mathews suggests that beings and ecosystems can self-determine.58 In similar vein, Iain McGilchrist says “the history of the cosmos looks like one of constant divergence into multiplicity and uniqueness, yet a uniqueness that is always subsumed within, and understood against the background of, a coherent whole.”59

The issue I am bringing into question is the assumption, in these statements of Mathews and McGilchrist, of coherence or indivisibility or unbreakability. From the scientific point of view, these terms infer a pre-ordained, deterministic process in which there is no possibility of the emergence of novelty, nor any freedom or uniqueness. If the One is a coherent, seamless, indivisible Whole, then, from the perspective of science, nothing unexpected or novel can happen. If the One is unbreakable then ‘the many’ can only emerge in a way that is pre-ordained and pre-determined.

24 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



But evidence shows that the universe is not perfectly deterministic – neither in the sense of working like clockwork, nor in the sense of being a coherent indivisible Whole [72]. On the other hand, nor is it merely random and chaotic. Rather – and this is the important point – it is incoherently interconnected, allowing for patterns of relation-ships or wholes to emerge, stabilise and ultimately fall away. These patterns intersect, blend and mutually affect each other.

And it is this incoherent, imperfect connectedness that allows for novelty, adaptability, evolution and surprise. It leads to temporary stabilisation of form, it gives primacy to relationship yet also embraces impermanence, flow and creative change.

There is not a whole, but many such wholes. David Hall and Roger Ames60



To summarise



Embracing this idea of incoherent connectivity, of imperfect connection leads to a universe of ‘wholes’ – temporary, intersecting, imprecise – but not an indivisible Whole. It is this connectivity and local patterning coupled with cracks and sinkholes and fractures in the ‘fabric’ that allows for novelty, freshness and response to context and circumstance.

[The universe is] a vast, self-organizing, complex system, the emergent properties of

which are … everything. Neil Theise61



Wholes in society

Let me apply this thinking to the ways societies have emerged over centuries.

First, there were small groups that settled together, sometimes traded, sometimes

fought, sometimes joined together. Eventually groups grew into cities and these warred,

traded and connected. Sometimes nations or empires emerged, with their own cultures

and with power to impact the cities and citizens within their reach. These constellations

of people, at every level, were unique and distinct; and they constantly interacted and

shaped each other, upwards, downwards and sideways. Often the higher level – the na-

tion – could constrain and shape the future behaviour of its citizens and groups. They

are wholes embedded in larger wholes – ‘wholes’ at every level.

This negotiated, shifting, indefinite, incomplete interconnecting society, described

above, is a good metaphor, I think, for the way the universe is, in some sense, a ‘whole’.



So …



Platonic philosophical ideas deeply influenced the tradition of classical science. Classi-cal science focused on universal laws and tended to ignore, and had no explanation for, the rich, ever-changing diversity of form in the universe.

5 Unity and uniqueness 25



From the point of view of the old Newtonian-style physics, the structure of the world

is accidental … it gives a picture of the universe where life, variety and structure are

improbable accidents. Smolin62



Daoists, as I will explore in Section III, are much more comfortable with the ‘particular’ rather than the universal – and the particular is the territory of complexity too. I hope this piece provides some additional background for this topic.

Is there no thing at all?



How successive developments in physics gradually removed notions of matter, time

and space.



I want at this stage to explore how successive waves of physics further deconstruct the machine view of reality. I’ve considered determinism [3] [4] and I’ve brought into

question a universe defined by universals and absolutes [5]. Here I am examining the assumption that the universe is made of solid, fixed ‘things’ moved around by forces.63



Forces as fields



By the nineteenth century, Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell showed how electromagnetic objects interact via electromagnetic fields.64 These classical force-fields demonstrate how the forces that act on objects change over space.

A great way to envisage a forcefield in two dimensions is to place two magnets on a piece of paper and scatter iron filings around them. The magnetic field is then revealed in the patterns taken up by the iron filings. Another sort of field occurs in sound, illus-trated by connecting a metal plate covered in sand to an audio source and seeing the patterns that arise, as illustrated in ‘Unity and uniqueness’ [5]. These are interference patterns, whereby the edges of the plate reflect back the sound waves which then interact with those going outwards. The same thing occurs when throwing a stone into a pond; you can notice the ensuing ripples bouncing back from the banks.

These examples show how forces present themselves, in many cases, as dispersed properties of objects. Planets ‘create’ gravitational fields around them, and planets mutually impact each other through these fields. Objects with electric charge and/or magnetic properties interact in the same way.

What all this work on field theories demonstrates is that forces cannot be thought of as separate from objects; things create forcefields and forcefields act on things.



Gravitational forces are really distortions of space



The next chronological step occurred as a result of Einstein’s work on relativity.65 This new theory of gravity further challenged the notion that forces and objects were separate, through reconsidering the nature of space. Up to then, space had been a sort of unchanging background against which, or in which, events happened. Einstein showed how an object in space distorts the shape of space itself. In two dimensions this looks like a heavy ball on a rubber membrane – the ball sinks into the membrane and 28 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



other objects ‘fall towards’ the heavier one. Gravity is no longer a force but is under-stood as a reshaping of space itself.



E=mc2: things aren’t things forever



The next nail in the coffin of things: Einstein intuited the relationship between energy and matter in his famous equation, E=mc2. Energy begets matter (as in the heart of a fiercely burning star which creates elements of higher mass, such as iron) and matter begets energy (think nuclear bomb). Things aren’t things forever.



Quantum physics – things dissolve



Finally, quantum physics destroys the idea that there are little building blocks – particles – out of which matter is formed. In Newton’s view, things are made of smaller things which are made of yet smaller things. But now, with the advent of quantum physics, matter is no longer seen as ‘real’ in this way, but ‘dissolves’ into quantum fields. These fields are dispersed in space; they are ambiguously, paradoxically there and not there; they are not really real at all.

I came across the following long quote by Bernard Kastrup, which I include as I cannot better it as a description of the way quantum physics destroys the foundations of classical materialism.

But we’ve known at least since the late 1940s … that what we call ‘particles’ aren’t par-

ticles at all: they are merely local patterns of excitation of a spatially unbound quantum

field. Think of ‘particles’ as ripples on a lake: each ripple has a certain height, thickness,

speed and direction of movement, which are the ripple’s defined physical properties.

They also have defined locations in space: you can point at a part of the lake and say,

“there’s a ripple!” Yet, there is nothing to the ripple but the lake itself. The ripple is not a

standalone entity, but a behaviour of the lake; it’s not a thing but a ‘doing.’ This is why

you cannot grab a ripple and lift it off the lake.



In precisely the same way, Quantum Field Theory66 … tells us that the so-called parti-

cles are just ‘ripples’ of a quantum field. In essence, there are no true particles; we use this

word today only metaphorically, and for historical reasons. There are only quantum

fields, which are spatially unbound.67



Even time is not time as we know it



The final blow to our everyday view of reality comes from quantum gravity – an area of physics that has certainly not yet landed but is aiming to bring together quantum physics and relativity. Einstein’s relativity had already put an end to absolute time – a universe moving along according to God’s ‘ticking clock’ [3]. Einstein introduced

6 Is there no thing at all? 29



relative time encapsulated in the story of two twins, one of whom time travels and the other does not; when the time traveller returns, he is younger than his twin.

But quantum gravity overturns even the level of precision inherent in relative time. Furthermore, it also destroys the illusion of the existence of absolute or even relative space. It suggests that space and time can only be defined in relation to two (or more) interacting ‘objects’ [73].

Rovelli writes clearly and evocatively about these ideas in The Order of Time.68 Time, Rovelli says, is absent as part of the constitutive fabric of the universe. “The present,” he says, “is defined only in our vicinity in an approximate way.”69 Daoist cosmology takes the same view [23:6]. Ames and Hall say: “The Chinese tradition does not have the separation between time and entities that would allow for either time without entities or entities without time”.70

Rovelli continues: “The absence of time does not mean that everything is frozen and unmoving.”71 The world, he says, “is in a ceaseless process of change.”72

The incessant happening that wearies the world is not ordered along a timeline, is not

measured by a gigantic tick-tocking. Rovelli73



In summary



You may be wondering, why am I so keen to spell this out? Partly because this history of the dissolution of ‘things’ and the questioning of the nature of time and space does not just bring into question – but even more firmly buries – the idea that being scientific is to adopt a machine worldview.

Furthermore, it creates a foundation stone for process complexity [9], and for process philosophies more generally [35].

Rovelli explains that quantum gravity implies:

The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events. … Even the things

that are most ‘thing-like’ are nothing more than long events. … The world is not so much

made of stones as of fleeting sounds or waves moving through the sea.74



This idea of things being better thought of as events – some long, some small – is the stuff of process philosophies [35], forms the basis of process complexity [10] and is inherent to Daoism.

Darwin and evolution: another sort of science



Showing how Darwin changed the game in science and philosophy and introduced the

fundamental role of variation in engendering change.



On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, had an enormous impact on philosophy, science and even on literature. 75 Up to that point, philosophy and science had searched for uniformity and viewed chaos or messiness as something to overcome [5]. Darwin’s great contribution was to recognise that messiness was generative; variation was a fundamental condition for nature to be able to adapt to changing conditions and for the emergence of novelty.

Furthermore, Darwin showed that evolutionary change starts locally, bottom up. And evolution is path-dependent – what has emerged shapes and limits what can happen next [15]. For example, animals early on developed the basic structure of two eyes and four limbs and that structure has tended to endure. Nature does not generally start again from scratch.

A science dependent on variation, where what happens is shaped by history and by the local context, is a very different sort of science to that embraced by Newton and others; it embeds uncertainty within it. We cannot know in advance what will emerge locally, it depends on local conditions and features. We also cannot know if any changes will sustain and spread. Even if we understand the core mechanisms, we cannot predict the outcomes. It is not possible to predict what new species and ecological patterns will emerge. The concept of emergence was established [19].

Darwinism involves a general theory of the evolution of all open, complex systems

[and] a basic philosophical commitment to detailed, cumulative causal explanations.

Geoffrey Hodgson76

Darwin’s ideas had an amazing influence on intellectual thought at the time and influ-enced many diverse fields including philosophy, science, literature and economics. His ideas sparked the interest, in the late nineteenth century, of a group of philosophers who came to be called process philosophers [35]. They started to consider whether it wasn’t more useful and realistic to regard the world as ‘in process’ – a world that is constantly shifting and changing and emerging, rather than, in line with classical physics, as fixed and predictable. Henri Bergson’s Creative Evolution77 shaped Prigogine’s considerations of open systems [8].

Darwin’s work also sparked the interest of writers such as Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence, as described by Gillian Beer in Darwin’s Plots.78

As Beer tells us, Darwin also approached and wrote about science in a way that was untypical for scientists at the time, when scientists wished to be certain and assured. 32 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



Beer explains that Darwin wrote The Origin as a tentative and time-sequenced story of how he came to the still-provisional conclusion that evolution had at its heart the principles of variation and selection. As you can see from the excerpt below, Beer views his writing as an example of how the medium embraces the message:

Darwin’s language does not close itself off authoritatively nor describe its own circum-

ference. … He sought to move out beyond the false security of authority or even of

the assumption that full knowledge may be reached.79 … Evolutionary theory is first a

form of imaginative history. It cannot be experimentally demonstrated sufficiently in

any present moment.80 … Darwin’s work … is the description of a process of becoming

and such a process does not move constantly in one direction.81



Evolutionary science also impacted the thinking of Thorstein Veblen, who, in 1898, wrote Why is economics not an evolutionary science?82 He scathingly suggests that eco-nomics is “helplessly behind the times”83 in sticking to the view that the economy tends to reach a balanced equilibrium. He introduced the term “dispassionate cumulative causation”84 to describe the path-dependent evolutionary process.

Evolution also impacted the physical sciences and was of central importance to Prigogine’s work on open systems [8]. Smolin suggests that the evolutionary principle applies even at the level of the universe. He says:

I remember wondering whether, if the earth can be understood as a self-organizing

system, maybe the same thing is true for the universe as a whole. … It seemed to me

that the only principle powerful enough to explain the high degree of organization of

our universe – compared to a universe with the particles and forces chosen randomly –

was natural selection itself.85



Smolin emphasises that “the environment that determines how successful any particular organism will be is largely made up of other organisms. … So, there is a community of organisms which in some sense collectively determine the different niches as they evolve together.”86 For this to work requires synergistic interdependencies and diversity, themes that are taken up in complexity thinking [11]. This is a development of the initial idea of survival of the fittest where the primary emphasis was on competition.



In summary



Evolutionary theory was a very different sort of science to what had gone before. It provided an understanding of how evolution happens but showed that we cannot pre-dict what will evolve. It showed how variation leads to path dependence and emer-gence. It was a central inspiration for the science of open systems and the development of complexity theory. Embracing diversity, messiness, the non-standard and the con-textual stands in contrast to the fixation, of the classical physicist, with the universal and the eternal.

Messiness is next to openness87



Showing how Prigogine worked with ideas from evolutionary science and the science of

open systems and arrived at complexity theory.



Here I focus on the science of open systems and the way this led into complexity science. The ontological view we arrive at – a contextual, emerging, patterned,

path-dependent perspective – is already emerging through the science explored thus far. Ilya Prigogine, on whom this piece focuses, unravels more of the reasons why.

Prigogine was a Russian-born physical chemist; he lived and worked most of his life in Brussels. Evolutionary theory brought home to Prigogine that classical physics tends to focus on closed systems. In closed systems [4] the problem is relatively straight-forward as there are definite, impermeable boundaries; thus nothing outside the prob-lem of interest can affect it. Prigogine, however, realised that for open systems, systems that can interact with their surroundings, it is possible for ‘form’ or ‘structure’ – in the sense of patterns – to emerge [14]. What particular patterns emerge depends on his-tory and context and is reliant on the particular details that happen to be present. It is the openness to the surroundings that provides the fuel to allow the creation of more sophisticated and complex structures.

In one fell swoop, with this word open, Prigogine was able to connect physics with bi-ology, and to show the resonance between the physics of open systems and the theory of evolution. In this, he laid the foundations for complexity theory. He wrote his first paper on non-equilibrium thermodynamics in 1947,88 and he received the Nobel Prize for this insight in 1977.89

Prigogine recalls in his Nobel autobiographical speech that inspiration came to him as a young man when reading Creative Evolution by Henri Bergson. In particular, he was struck by Bergson asking: “Why does life mount the incline that matter descends?”90 Bergson was referring to the seeming contradiction between physics and evolution. Life has a tendency to evolve from simple forms, like amoeba, to ever-more-complex forms, like primates. But physics only seems to have two types of theories. Either things behave in a machine-like way91 and stay the same forever or advance in pre-dictable ways; or there is the physics of equilibrium thermodynamics which suggests that gases and liquids tend to lose structure and energy and move towards featureless, uniform states of lowest energy (associated with increases of entropy, a measure of disorder). This minimum energy state is called equilibrium or heat death [72]. Both of these physics theories assume closed situations.

What Prigogine realised, is that for open systems that can exchange energy or matter or information with the wider world, the tendency towards loss of order and eventual death can be reversed; order can emerge locally and entropy, locally, can decrease. 34 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



The situation sucks energy into itself from its surroundings to fuel this reversal of the norm. This does not change the inevitable plod of the whole towards heat death, but it is what gives us life and stars in the meantime.

The thermodynamics of open situations not in equilibrium, where there is interaction with the wider context, thus brings congruence between physics and evolutionary theory. Both can lead to an increase of order locally. This was very exciting. It is not suggesting that such ordering lasts forever or always happens; death, dissolution and decay happen too and indeed are inevitable in a universe that does not have an inexhaustible supply of energy. But recognising that open systems, be they living or not, can demonstrate a tendency for patterns and order to emerge, was a huge realisation.

Prigogine, being Russian-born, was able to find experimental examples of such local reversals of entropy, where patterns emerge, in the work of two Russians, Boris Belousov and Anatol Zhabotinsky.92 Their work took place in the early 1950s and was only available at the time in Russian. The Belousov-Zhabotinksy (BZ) reaction occurs with certain combinations of chemicals in a petri dish. Much to everyone’s astonishment, patterns and swirls emerged on the surface of the liquid, intersect-ing and disappearing and re-surfacing over time, and eventually dying away as the chemicals were exhausted. This is an example of “order out of chaos.”93 There seemed no way at the time to explain what caused the patterns and the work was not taken seriously. Prigogine was later able to show, in his work on non-equilibrium thermody-namics, that such order could be sustained if the system were open – in this case, if a continuous inflow of reagents and an outflow of reaction products was provided.

Ilya Prigogine called the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction “one of the most important

discoveries of the century”.94



Order can seem like a peculiar word to use here, as the patterns in reactions like the BZ reaction, or the emergence of new species, are not ordered in the sense that the form of the patterns is predictable or easily defined or settles into a fixed stable state. But the patterns that emerge and sustain for a while, have an integrity or order that is distinguishable from chaos, where there would be no features at all.95 Complexity theory, in the tradition of Prigogine, has its roots in the thermodynamics of open systems. Open systems can exchange energy, information and matter with their surroundings. This openness is necessary for patterns to sustain but in addition, there needs to be some sort of relational feedback mechanisms between constituents, which can lead to the emergence and stabilising of self-organising, self-regulating patterns. Section II is devoted to unpacking these ideas.



8 Messiness is next to openness 35



Path-dependency



I wanted to add a further important point. Classical thermodynamics as applied to sim-ple gases and liquids, ignores the importance of the sequence of collisions or the context in which they happen. One molecule of hydrogen is indistinguishable from another molecule. These simplifying assumptions work well for gases and liquids, but these simplifications do not apply in general. When the concepts of thermodynamics are applied to more complex situations, with lots of different types of entities interacting via a range of types of interactions (nuclear, electromagnetic, gravitational), then the path the system happens to follow matters.96

We see this path-dependency in the BZ reaction. The patterns that emerged on the surfaces of the petri dishes change over time and also, if the experiment is run again, are never repeated. It is as if the system has a memory of the stages it has passed through; its current state is shaped by what occurred on the way. What happens in each step shapes and narrows the possibilities of what can happen next and in the future. Stuart Kauffman notes that this tendency, this narrowing of options, called non-ergodicity, also occurs at the level of the universe. He explains that this process is necessary for highly unlikely things, such as life, to have a chance of emerging.

The evolution of life in our biosphere is profoundly … historical. The universe will not

create all possible life forms. Kauffman97



I’ve been very taken with the way William James, understood this point. I quoted his words on determinism in [4]. Regarding indeterminism, he says:

Indeterminism … says that the parts have a certain amount of loose play on one another.

… It admits that possibilities may be in excess of actualities, and that things … may really

in themselves be ambiguous … actualities seem to float in a wider sea of possibilities.

Of two alternative futures which we conceive, both may now really be possible; and

the one becomes impossible only at the very moment when the other excludes it by

becoming real itself.98



In this quote, James captures several aspects of indeterminism:

First: Things are not perfectly defined, there is not just one path forwards; the ‘loose play’, which Peter Allen referred to as “excess diversity,”99 allows for adaptations.

Second: As we cannot pin down which adaptations will come into play, there is ambiguity, to use James’ word, as to which path will manifest.

Third: James understands this leads to historicity or path-dependency – that the future depends on what has happened up to now.

Fourth: He recognises that what was previously possible is no longer available when one path is selected; the range of possible futures is narrowed. This is Kauffman’s non-ergodicity. As Kauffman says: “Non-ergodicity gives us history.”100 36 Section I The Long Walk to Freedom: the Developing Story of the Scientific Worldview



In conclusion



This section, The Long Walk to Freedom, starts with Newton and classical physics; I show the way this science is adopted as a philosophy, as a mechanical worldview that avows prediction, certainty, standardisation, right answers and universal truths [3] [5]. I’ve attempted to illustrate that the universe does not, in fact, behave in that fashion [4] and the mechanical worldview is not very apt as a ‘theory of everything’.

As I read through these pieces, I realise that the three most important reasons why we have to bury the mechanical worldview is because: (a) most situations are open to their wider context, (b) things are messy, and (c) things are interconnected or, to use the Daoist phrase, are ‘mutually entailed’ [28]. This paves the way for the discussion on ‘The conditions for complexity’ [11] in the next section.

In ‘Is there no thing?’ [6], I’ve also detoured into a discussion, building on quantum mechanics, that supports a more processual view of the world – a world not only in process but constituted of processes. This leads into a processual view of complexity.

Prigogine, impacted by Darwin [7], was not the only route into complexity, but the way his understanding emerged from classical science meeting evolution tells a very com-pelling story. His work led him and his colleagues into environmental science and even-tually into the social sciences. His later papers and debates illustrated how he reflected on the bigger picture and saw the importance of mindset and beliefs. I recommend Art meets Science and Spirituality in a changing economy101 and Science, Reason and Passion.102





Section II




Process Complexity

Introducing process complexity



What is complexity? What, indeed, is process complexity?



The science of complexity conveys a view of the world as dynamic, richly inter-dependent and full of variety. It is a world – organic and emergent, shaped by history and context – that is naturally patterned, yet always in process. The future, however, is not exhaustively capacious; it is not that anything can happen.

But is that what people imagine when there is talk of complexity? If I asked you to think of images that convey your idea of complexity, you might think of puppies playing with skeins of wool or children emptying the contents of the kitchen drawers into a heap on the floor. You might recall navigating your way through a souk or remember an unbelievably complicated diagram (I remember such a diagram) showing the political and economic forces at play in Afghanistan.1 The word complexity might suggest an impossible, chaotic, ambiguous, useless muddle: a bad thing we should aim to simplify, organise and master.

But what if complexity is the natural way of things, and in its depths lies the source of novelty and creativity and the emergence of the forms and patterns of which we are a part?

Nature is radically complex. Chris Mowles2



The Latin word complexus means that which is woven together, and it neatly captures the essential quality of complexity. What is the nature of this interwoven muddle, this interconnecting, undisciplined connectedness of which we are a part? This is an onto-logical, indeed a metaphysical question that seeks to understand ‘the nature of things’ [2]. And I argue that this quest is a necessary practice for all of us – not merely an amus-ing debate for philosophers, but a central grounding for how to live well. Our beliefs – about the nature of being, about how the world works, about what creates change or stability – drive our methods and behaviours. Without addressing these underlying as-sumptions and beliefs, we can do no more than strive to improve that which we were already doing.

The foundational inquiry underpinning my work is to ask what the science of complexity can reveal. In Section I, I sketched out the gradual complexification of science, starting with Newton’s ‘classical’ view of a universe of ‘things’ that follow laws which ‘lay down’ future behaviour. I brought that section to a close with Ilya Prigogine grappling with the question as to why classical physics and evolutionary biology seem to contradict each other. The word that brought these two sciences together was ‘open’. Situations that are open to their environments display emerging order in the form of patterns.

40 Section II Process Complexity



The emergence of patterns in the chemical experiments that so intrigued Prigogine ran counter to expectations [8]. But, as Prigogine and others realised, it is the possibility to exchange energy, material and information with the wider context that allows such patterns to emerge. For evolutionary processes at every level – from galaxies to amoeba – this ability to suck fuel from their surroundings is the source of complexification.



The emerging ontology of indeterminism, contingency

and process



In Section I, I traced the development of science from Newton to Prigogine. The onto-logical view that emerged by early twentieth century describes a very different uni-verse from the one Newton had envisaged, as described below.



The ontology of the universe by the early twentieth century

A universe that is not deterministic, does not work like a machine, and does not merely

unfold according to plan.

A dynamic universe of forms – forms that emerge, stabilise and eventually disintegrate,

and which are open to and engage with their wider environment.

A universe of interconnection and mutual interaction – sometimes strong, sometimes

tenuous.

A universe of messiness, where the lack of symmetry is a vital ingredient to enable the

emergence and evolution of forms.

A universe contingent on context, where no part is the same as any other.

A universe that is not objectively real in the way we imagine, but, due to the weird be-

haviour at the quantum level, has a sort of intrinsic paradoxical quality that creates a

source of mystery.

A universe in process, always becoming, where ‘what is’ shapes but does not determine

the path for the future to emerge.



As the above summary indicates, by the early twentieth century most of the ingredients for developing complexity theory – a path-dependent, evolving, interconnected uni-verse, shaped by messiness, particular to context and not made of definitive ‘things’ – had emerged through successive scientific developments which built on the founda-tions set by Newton.

One of the reasons I feel complexity science is so important is because it gains its authority from its roots in science, even as it brings into question the ontology of classical science. These roots provide a solid foundation from which to offer a legiti-mate challenge to the adoption of the mechanical worldview as a relevant model for the social and natural world [3]. An aim to be appropriately scientific in the living world is generally better served by ‘embracing complexity’. It is a better fit. Assuming the

9 Introducing process complexity 41



world is controllable and predictable when it is not, does not make it so. Complexity will not just go away if you ignore it.

There can be a fear that if we let go of the machine perspective, we will tumble about with the puppies and the wool, learn nothing and get nowhere. We fear that, if we do face that complexity, we will find it so multifaceted and intertwined that, as we can’t know everything, we may end up knowing nothing. But complexity science says more about the world than ‘it’s all complex’. It provides insights and understandings that allow us to engage with that complexity, make sense of the seeming muddle and be skilful in our responses. Indeed, variation and muddle are vital; they are a source – perhaps even the source – of creativity, novelty, adaptability, and flourishing.



What’s so special about process complexity?



Complexity theory in various forms has been around since at least the 1980s. It has been developed through mathematical modelling in particular, and also through philo-sophical endeavours and experiential work. Section IV, Other Resonant Perspectives, reviews this broader field, as does Embracing Complexity written with Peter Allen and Cliff Bowman.3

In much of the work on complexity there lies an implicit assumption that we can con-ceive of the world as made up of concrete things joined up by forces. Complexity think-ing may allow for these forces to be more complicated, but a sort of realist perspective is still often adopted. Indeed, as I discuss in ‘The raw and the cooked’ [31], complexity thinking can still remain within the paradigms of classical science, and just provide a more sophisticated form of mechanics with which to operate.

But I want to take it further. My aim in this section is to articulate process complexity – a view of complexity that moves us from an image of concretely objective ‘things which interact’ towards an image of entities that are more akin to ripples on a river. It also emphasises the processual nature of the complex world, and in addition includes aspects of the world that are not localised, such as wind or mood.

Ripples provide a great metaphor for a rethink of the nature of ‘things’. Ripples have form and a certain degree of independence, but they indivisibly interact with other ripples, currents, vortices and anything else present. Ripples are paradoxically both separate and not separate; they are identifiable and yet ever-changing.

Process complexity emphasises the processual, systemic, patterned, situational, paradoxical and emergent nature of reality. This is a reality shared by galaxies, ecologies and communities.

The future is under perpetual construction. Ilya Prigogine.4 42 Section II Process Complexity



I don’t wish to claim too much credit for coining the notion of process complexity.5 Prigogine was certainly heading in that direction, and other process thinkers, including Daoists, have also reached a view of the world as essentially constituted by processes in process, as discussed in Sections III and IV. But a processual framing of complexity does, I feel, offer a unique and valuable perspective to process thinking, grounded, as it is, in science. For example, process complexity can allow for an exploration of the way patterns form, stabilise and dissolve [14], or provide a frame through which to distin-guish different types of emergence [19].



In this Section



In this section, I consider the implications not only of recognising a world in process, as did Prigogine, but a world of processes, a world of patterns.

The next piece, ‘A complex view of process’, considers what it means to position complexity as a processual ontology.

In ‘The essential conditions for complexity’, I then discuss the conditions necessary for complexity – openness, diversity and reflexive relationships.

In ‘Characteristically complex’, I briefly introduce the characteristics of a processual complex world and explain how they fit together. These characteristics are:

systemic, patterned, path-dependent, particular, punctuated, paradoxical and

emergent.

In later pieces, I then explore each of these characteristics in turn, considering in more detail what they mean and how they manifest in the social world.



And so, to summarise …



The complexity perspective suggests that the world is constantly shifting. Further-more, it illustrates that the never-ending adjustments at the micro-level support resil-ience of the ecology, community or situation. Paradoxically, such variations also allow for new patterns of relationships to emerge. The complex world is, indeed, composed of such patterns – norms, cultures, ways of doing things, embedded relationally-shaped choices. These patterns emerge, stabilise and ultimately dissolve; they self-organise through the interweaving between their constitutive elements.

The future can be thought of as a dance between patterns and particularities. Current patterns of relationships may potentially be strengthened or disturbed by variations, events, shifts in alliances, modifications in taste, step changes in the wider environment and so on. These patterns do not exist independently of their constitutive elements

9 Introducing process complexity 43



but are maintained by repeating, circling, interdependent behaviours, and through the favouring of certain connections over others. Such patterns develop over time and are shaped by history and context.

Process complexity depicts a world in process, a world that is always becoming. It embraces the paradox that within stability lie the seeds of instability, and within chaos lie the seeds of order. It disavows universal truths and underlines the importance of contextual detail.

Embracing this perspective can seem obvious or subtle, exciting or irritating, rich or overwhelming, depending on your point of view. But in that embracing is offered the promise of an understanding that can lead to discernment and judicious action.

In this section, I focus on unpicking and exploring process complexity as a worldview. Many of the features I describe are not radically different from those you may have already come across if you have some familiarity with complexity thinking – but there is, I suggest, a greater focus on process, pattern and paradox, a re-thinking of the characteristics of a complex world in process, and a drilling down into the nature of emergence, patterning and path dependency.





10


A complex view of process



The emphasis on the processual nature of the complex world. A world in process constituted

of processes.



In this piece, I want to draw out what underlies the integration of a complexity world-view with a process orientation and articulate ‘process complexity’.



A processual worldview



My starting point is that the complex world is necessarily processual in nature. This builds on the direction in which Prigogine was already heading. For example, Erich Jantsch in The Self-organizing Universe, a book dedicated to Prigogine, notes that a “pro-cess orientation”,6 influenced by the ideas of Henri Bergson, underpinned Prigogine’s work. One of Prigogine’s books was titled From Being to Becoming,7 implying that con-stant dynamic change and movement – not stasis – is the norm in the world. Neverthe-less, the substance of a processual view of complexity was not developed.

To put it in context, classical scientists ask what the world is; they start with a stable world of stable things – things that interact, things that can change, but, in the main, tend to stay pretty stable. This is a world of being – a world of stasis that only sometimes changes.

In contrast, a process orientation or process ontology posits that change is the norm and regards stability as a special case. The world according to process thinkers is essentially dynamic, changing and in flow. Process thinkers often tend to focus on verbs and adjectives as opposed to nouns – patterning not pattern, a world of becoming not being.

To say the wind is blowing has already made the wind into a thing; but actually, it is the

blowing that makes it wind. Chris Mowles8



The idea of process complexity not only captures a view of the world as ‘always becoming’ but also leaves behind the idea of a world made of concrete ‘things’. In this sense it goes further than a dynamical view. A dynamical view can offer up a world that changes due to the complex interactions between things. At its core, though, still lurks the image of a world of substance, a world that is real, concrete and objectively there. Process complexity goes further than this and brings an end to ‘things’.



46 Section II Process Complexity



The end of things; the primacy of processes



The shift to process complexity gives up on ‘things’ in a number of ways.

First, process complexity includes ingredients that do not resemble localised entities, although they have agency and existence. Here, I think of the weather, the ripples on the ocean, the atmosphere in a wood or in a church, dust clouds or mycelium net-works beneath the soil. John Dupré describes aspects such as rain, wind, electricity as “commonplace examples of subject-less or ‘unowned’ processes”.9 Timothy Morton describes these as ‘hyper objects’.10

Secondly, process complexity does not exclude the inner world of thoughts and feel-ings, instincts and imaginings.

Thirdly, it suggests that ‘things’ are best thought of as patterns of relationships; they are constituted through the inter-relationships between their constituents. The language of some schools of Buddhism refers to such patterns as ‘empty’ in the sense that they do not have an enduring existence, they are not fixed entities but are ‘held in place’ through the relations between their constitutive elements.

Emptiness: There is no self-defining discrete reality to cause or effect. Forms or feel-

ings are devoid of inherent existence; it is only on the basis of aggregation of subtle

elements that forms exist; forms can only be understood in relational terms to their

constitutive elements. Dalai Lama interpreting the Milarepa text11



Furthermore, patterns are made of inter-relating patterns, which are made of even smaller patterns. Indeed ultimately, from the perspective of quantum physics, any ‘thing-like-ness’ vanishes into interpenetrating fields of energy. The material world is in fact, when it comes down to it, rather immaterial.

There is another point too lurking within quantum mechanics: At the quantum level, properties only manifest through relationships, and qualities that manifest in one relationship may not manifest in another. I discuss this further in ‘Smoke and mirrors’, in the Appendix [73].

Relationships do not merely shape reality, they are reality. Shawn Wilson12



So, is anything a thing? As Rovelli would suggest, even rocks or stars are just temporary constellated patterns; it is all a matter of timescale. And, if I consider an individual – myself – then, as discussed in Section VI, Becoming Ourselves, I am both changing and evolving as time goes by, and I am equally responding to the moment, depending on the circumstances – my breakfast, who I am with, what I am worrying about. The self-organising process that leads to relatively stable patterns, of which I am an exam-ple, is both held together and challenged by the interweaving of all that constitutes me, both inner and outer, both tangible and intangible.

By introducing a processual view, we understand ‘things’ as interpenetrating patterns, patterns which may be fleeting or persistent. In so doing, we uncover a more nuanced and inclusive perspective of the complex world.

10 A complex view of process 47



Furthermore, we do not only leave ‘things’ behind, but the distinction between things and forces also becomes blurred. Instead, we can envisage interactions akin to the way ripples interact on the ocean. Ripples are identifiable entities, albeit temporary and with ill-defined boundaries. They impact each other, may merge, may separate again, and may disappear. We would not describe their interactions and impacts as caused by forces; they interact due to their own characteristics (of speed, amplitude, tempera-ture, density), due to their unique nature, at a particular place and time. So, in replacing ‘things’ with the idea of processes or patterns, ‘forces’ are no longer a separate aspect. This is discussed further in ‘Is there no thing at all?’ [6].



Process complexity – processes all the way down



The term process complexity encapsulates a complexity ontology that takes us away from Modernism’s entrancement with things and sees ‘thing-like-ness’ as temporary and relationally constituted. Accordingly, forces are best thought of as the interpene-tration of entities and their surrounding forcefields.

This interpretation is not unique to complexity; it is a central tenet of most process philosophies [35]. The central concept is that process – be it cohering, stabilising, or dis-solving – is primary. Processes create ‘forms’, which may, for a time, be ‘substantial’ – have substance; that time period may be long or short. But any substantial forms emerge as a result of, and are secondary to, processes.

What is a process?



Defining process is not as straightforward as it sounds, and when digging into various works on process philosophy,13 I observed with interest how difficult it is to pin down. Process signifies the ‘mechanisms’ through which things come together, create forms and then move apart. Process contains a sense of flow and movement. Process is not something separate from substance, but that which causes substance to become sub-stantial. You can’t separate ripple from rippling, or energy from energy fields.

There is a process tradition in biology, explored by Dupré and others in Everything Flows: towards a processual philosophy of biology. They say:

Instead of thinking of processes as belonging to things, we should think of things as

being derived from processes … [it implies that] things cannot be regarded as the basic

building blocks of reality. What we identify as things are no more than transient pat-

terns of stability in the surrounding flux, temporary eddies in the continuous flow of

process.14



Nicholas Rescher would argue that process is the most pervasive, characteristic and crucial feature of reality.15

48 Section II Process Complexity



One point to emphasise: a pattern is itself a self-organising process, a form of process that reflects back on itself, as I discuss further in [14]. The world is processes ‘all the way down’.16

A word of warning – a world in process – what it does and doesn’t mean



I’ve so far emphasised the view that ‘things’ are really relationally interwoven, dynam-ically held patterns. Patterns are located in time and space. However, over time, such patterns may emerge, intersect, change, morph, dissolve and emerge as new patterns. There is flow, there is always becoming. Nothing is fixed forever. As I’ve emphasised, processual worldviews in general take the position that change, rather than stability, is the norm.

But what does that mean? Does this imply that we will experience everything as tem-porary, fleeting, disconnected, blown by the winds of chance? That we have no impact on where we are heading; that all is random, indeterminate, formless, chaotic – just one disconnected step after another? Or maybe it implies we are in a fixed process, a predictable sequence of events inexorably trudging along a pre-determined path to a pre-determined goal? Process complexity is espousing neither a ‘random walk’ nor a fixed path, but something complexly, contextually, in between.

Equally, this idea of flow intrinsic to process complexity does not imply a flow towards, a sense of direction or destination; it does not imply that there is necessarily prog-ress or complexification or increasing sophistication of form. Situations may adapt but they may equally well collapse. Entities may emerge that are more sophisticated than earlier ones (such as, one can argue, the human form compared to a cockroach), but equally there is no reason to suppose that the future is necessarily better than the past. Humankind does not necessarily ‘civilise’; progress is not inevitable.17



In summary



Process complexity can take its place within the broad church of process philosophy, a church which is rich and varied, and includes many flavours and colours. In ‘Process philosophies [35], I provide an overview of this broad field of thought.

What, in particular, does process complexity have to offer compared with other pro-cess philosophies? It gives its own insight into the way patterns pattern, into the way flow flows. Building on its roots in science [8], it is saying more than ‘the world is com-plex, messy, interpenetrating and in constant flow’. Process complexity gives a defini-tive grounding to understanding the processual; it conveys the image of a non-smooth flow with a ‘lumpy’ texture. Think of a mountain stream – shaping and being shaped by its environs; its vortices and rapids, its whirlpools and indents and eddies always changing, yet often maintaining shape. The complex world is more like a mountain stream, full of interest, form and attitude, than like a smoothly flowing river.

10 A complex view of process 49



The processual understanding of the complex world has irreversibility [3] at its root and leads to an understanding that situations are constantly adapting – shaped but not determined by history and context, with the potential for the emergence of qualities never before seen.

The rest of this section is given to developing an overview of the essential conditions and characteristics of this processual complex worldview.

The essential conditions for complexity



Inter-relatedness, diversity and openness are the necessary conditions that lead to the

emergence, sustaining and ultimate dissolving of patterns of relationships. This gets to the

heart of what engenders the complex world.



I want to bring to life the conditions under which the complex world is at its richest – what you might call its ‘essential ingredients’. What are the underpinning necessities

that lead to and engender the qualities or characteristics of the complex world – its processual, patterned, responsive, paradoxical, emergent nature? What leads to the emergence and stabilisation of patterns of relationships?



Separating conditions from the characteristic they produce



I recognise that, compared to other complexity thinkers, separating out the conditions from the characteristics of the complex world is an unusual step to take. Rika Preiser et al., for example, present the following list of what they call organising principles.18 These principles suggest that ‘complex adaptive systems’:

1. are constituted relationally

2. have adaptive capacities

3. involve dynamic processes

4. are radically open

5. are contextually determined

6. demonstrate novel qualities that emerge through complex causality

Broadly, I am not in disagreement with Preiser, other than to suggest that things being constituted relationally (1) and radically open to their surroundings (4) are the condi-tions that engender their dynamic (3), emergent (6) and contextual nature (5). In other words (1) and (3) create the conditions for the rest.

In similar vein, Reason and Goodwin, suggest six principles of complexity.19 These are:

1. rich interconnections

2. iterative

3. emergence

4. holism

5. fluctuations

6. edge of chaos

I would argue that 1, 2 and 5 are the conditions that lead to the potential for emergence and holism. The existence or not of the edge of chaos is a whole other topic which I will sidestep here!20

52 Section II Process Complexity



The approaches of Preiser and of Reason and Goodwin are not uncommon, but I be-lieve it is helpful to distinguish conditions from the characteristics they give rise to. Not to do so results in a so-called ‘category error’.21 In other words, we are mixing up fruit with seeds! Paying attention to this distinction can provide a richer and more nuanced understanding of the nature of the complex world.



So, what are the conditions for complexity?



At the end of ‘Messiness is next to openness’ [8], I summarise the conditions for com-plexity that emerged from Prigogine’s work. The three conditions for complexity to fully be realised are:

• open boundaries

• diversity

• reflexive inter-relationships between constituents

In essence, if patterned forms – such as those emerging in chemicals in a petri dish, or in a pond or community – aren’t able to interact with, aren’t open to the wider world, they won’t ultimately be able to sustain themselves. Equally, if ‘ingredients’ are not diverse, but are all identical, like the molecules in hydrogen gas, then nothing substantive can change. Thirdly, if interactions and connections are not reflexive, but fixed – such as those between the rods and cogs of a weaving machine, or indeed those between molecules in a container of gas – then we will not find the features we expect of a complex world.

To bring to life how these three conditions work together, I’d like to consider an exam-ple of the dynamics of a family.



The dynamics of a family

If I told you there was a right way to bring up a family, or a right way to conduct a friend-

ship, you would simply not take me seriously. You would most likely tell me that families

are made up of diverse individuals who are all unique, and who impact each other in

complex, and varying and various ways – ways which are interdependent and some-

times mutually reinforcing. I upset you, and you take it out on our younger sister, who

cries, and Dad is furious, and he blames you, but actually it was my fault, so you are furi-

ous with me, and you take that out on our younger sister, and we find ourselves in that

familiar spiral. At this point Mum arrives home, and the dynamics change in response,

but return when Mum goes out. These are reflexive relationships – A affects B and B

affects A back, but if C is there, the relationship between A and B is different and both

impact C … and so on.



11 The essential conditions for complexity 53



In this way, family patterns emerge. And, despite the comings and goings on a day-

to-day basis illustrated above, it is often the case that certain familial patterns of re-

lationships start to establish themselves and sustain over time. These patterns are

unique to each family. Each family will display particular routines and norms – about

eating together, or around commitment to community activities, or expectations

of what can and cannot be discussed. If you visit another family, you will notice the

differences.

Families are also open to the outside world – they are impacted by friends and school,

or the state of the economy, by break ups, or through getting a dog. The boundary

between a family and the wider world is porous, sometimes ambiguous (where does

Grandma fit?), and is not fixed in stone. These outside influences may reinforce patterns

of behaviour or may disrupt them. The family and the people in it will change over time –

sometimes almost imperceptibly and sometimes more substantially. If one person tries

to change, the rest of the family might re-mould itself to accommodate that change, or it

may do the opposite. If something impinges from the outside, such as a war or a lottery

win, things might change radically and rapidly. The situation is never static, but it does

often settle into sustained patterns of behaviour.



A core condition for complexity is reflexive relationality. In the family, connections between people are not independent of each other, but shape and are shaped by the myriad iterative interactions which tend to form a complex web – a relatively stable, self-regulating pattern of relationships. Such a pattern may shift, form and re-form as people interact, react, impact each other, change alliances and respond to different events and situations. But for such patterns to emerge and sustain, they need reflexive multilateral feedback processes.

The second condition focuses on diversity. Each person is unique and changeable; interactions between people also vary and change over time.

Think of a playground: Each child present is unique, and her behaviour varies with circumstance; furthermore, the links and bonds between children will also shift and change, depending on the nature of the play or the vagaries of friendship. There is diversity between classifications (children, teachers, animals), within classifications (each child is unique) and within interactions (the bonds and interactions between players also shift and change).

Without diversity, there is a limit both to the propensity to adapt and the potential for the emergence of something new. Peter Allen named this the ‘law of excess diversity’.22 If we try to quell that diversity – through, for example, controlling who can engage with whom, or by insisting on conformity – then the group or ecology is constrained and less able to adapt and find new modes and ways of being. Maintaining diversity does not happen automatically and may need intervention as I discuss at the end of this piece.

Order [comes] through fluctuation. Prigogine23

54 Section II Process Complexity



The third essential ingredient is that situations need to be open to their surroundings. In the school playground, for example, children can join and leave, and they can be im-pacted by rain, the arrival of a teacher or another class. There are always comings and goings – and this applies to galaxies, and ecologies as well as to human communities.



A note on boundaries

In the example of the playground, it would be relatively straightforward to define

boundaries, but, in general, the boundaries of a complex situation are themselves

a self-organising property. For example, imagine a woodland starting to establish

itself naturally, through seeds dropped by birds or already buried in the soil. As trees

and other plants grow, the woodland may expand and then retreat a little depending

on conditions. The boundaries of the wood are likely to eventually settle in a place

that balances the synergies between the species within the wood against any impact

from what is happening outside the wood. Boundaries, in the same way as patterns of

relationships, are ‘self-organising’. Furthermore, boundaries are inevitably open. Even

a pendulum, a commonly used example of a closed system, is not entirely isolated from

the atmosphere and, over time, grows dusty and rusts.



So complex situations will naturally be open – and this is a necessary condition. In scien-tific terms, isolated closed situations ultimately run out of energy and die. Interactions take energy and, if no additional energy can get in, patterns cannot sustain. An open engagement with the wider world is vital in order to energise and provide resources. Ecologies are sustained through sunlight and the comings and goings of their visitors; cells in the body take in nutrients; societies, at the very least, need food, water and energy. Openness, as opposed to isolation and closedness, is a fundamental necessity in order that enough resources are fed in so that any emerging patterns can sustain.

A closed system view is extremely problematic when we begin to study living systems,

because no living system can be a closed system. Every living system exists within an

environment and has a relationship with that environment. Alfonso Montuori 24

Essentially, then, these are the three essential ingredients, the necessary conditions for a situation to display the characteristic features of a complex world: (1) a set of diverse and potentially diffuse ‘constituents’, (2) interacting in reflective, diverse and varying ways, and (3) situated in a broader context to which it is open and connected.



But are all situations complex?



One final point to consider: Are there situations in the human and natural world where these salient ingredients – of reflexive connection, diversity and openness – do not ex-ist? Are there any cases where we can claim a situation is not complex? I struggle to think of situations within the human and natural world, and indeed in the wider realms of the universe, where these conditions – of diversity, openness and reflexivity – do not apply. However smooth and ordered things may appear on the surface, it is the

11 The essential conditions for complexity 55



myriad weavings of diverse aspects of its constituents that are busy maintaining its order. That said, there are situations where diversity is suppressed or interactions with the wider world are minimised, as exemplified by the flora and fauna of Australia, discussed below.



The flora and fauna of Australia

In Australia, there are examples where environmental and climate conditions are so

stable, the location is so remote, and resources are so scarce, that specialisation is the

only way to survive.25

In these instances, there are few species and little deviation in the patterns of interaction –

between who or what eats whom. For example, all members of one species may congre-

gate on one lake for one night a year to mate. Or a particular insect lives two-thirds up

the stalk of a particular plant (as a different insect lives below). These situations have

evolved in this way in order to make efficient use of resources; but this creates a limit to

resilience. There is little diversity, little adaptation and minimal impact from the wider

context. This ecosystem, at least on the surface, begins to look more machine-like in its

behaviour – stable, measurable, with clear links, and identifiable, fixed patterns. But if

conditions change and these rigid balancing relationships are destroyed, then there is

everything to play for again – such changing conditions may engender collapse, or they

may draw forth and harness the diversity and the latent potential for adaptation that

was already available.



The point is that even when complexity is minimised, it never goes away and to ignore it is to miss the very factors that ultimately create change.

Enforcing conformity in human systems



The same can be said of human systems. Conformity can be imposed through fear and terror. It can also be engendered through recruitment processes which favour certain types of people over others. Rigidity can be enforced by maintaining strict rules of con-duct, and hierarchical organisations can have a stifling effect too. But underneath this surface conformity there is likely to be a seething diversity, a variety of informal or tacit ways of connecting. These hidden connections can form patterns and features that may be discouraged or rendered invisible but are nevertheless present. I discuss this further, in ‘Who got the power’ [70], in relation to societies under dictatorships.

Always open ...



In summary, no situation can entirely be disconnected from the wider world, and this wider engagement is what feeds and animates. Even the most isolated ecosystem is fed by the sun and watered by the rain and will ultimately be impacted by environmen-tal change; even the most isolated human community interacts outside of itself, if only with migrating animals or flowing rivers.

Characteristically complex



An introduction to the characteristics of a complex world and how these characteristics

weave together.



In the last piece [11], I described the conditions that engender complexity. These are: openness, ‘messiness’ or diversity, and reflexive relationships

In this piece, I want to explore how these conditions lead to the characteristics of com-plex situations. These characteristics are:

systemic, patterned, particular, path-dependent, paradoxical, punctuated

and emergent



These factors are fundamental to the essence, the ontological ground, of the complex world. I will describe each of them in detail later in this section. But here I sketch out how they weave together. Please note that in this brief summary I do not develop these terms in detail; that is the focus of the pieces that follow, which explore these concepts one by one. These terms are also defined in the Glossary.



How these characteristics weave together



Central to this taxonomy is the notion of patterns – self-organising patterns, consti-tuted relationally out of their intersecting mutually impacting elements, and sustained through their openness to the wider context. Patterning is the ‘binding thread’ of pro-cess complexity. It offers an image of the world as one of ‘emerging, stabilising and sub-sequently dissolving patterns’.

These patterns themselves intersect, and out of such intersections they become part of bigger patterns. It is patterns all the way up and all the way down! And, as I have mentioned and go on to discuss further in [14], these patterns can be thought of as self-reflecting processes. So, process complexity describes a world in process com-prised of processes.

The form of such patterns is particular to its context and particular to the specific nature of its constituents. Detail matters [16].

The development of a particular pattern is in addition affected by chance events, major shocks or sometimes minor variations within its constituent elements. This patterning process underpins a world that is always becoming. What happens is shaped by the particularities of what happens along the way and is thus path–dependent [15]. And, 58 Section II Process Complexity



as things constitute and reconstitute, new qualities may emerge - qualities that may be radically different from what has gone before [19].

The patterning process can go through stages, as discussed in detail in [14]. In certain conditions, patterns may be able to self-regulate and adapt to changing circumstances. Equally, in their early stages, they may be fragile and ephemeral and, yet over time, may become fixed and locked-in, and may also, ultimately, collapse. So, the path of becoming tends to be punctuated. That is to say, it displays periods of stasis during which we can be beguiled into imagining that the situation is stable, and the present will last forever. However, there are also periods of rapid or radical change, which may present as chaos or collapse or, sometimes, as a smoother transition into something radically new. In other words, the path is punctuated by periods of stability followed by periods of rapid change. I consider this process in more detail in [17].

The next quality is paradox [18]. This is a quality of the complex world that is some-times overlooked.26 Paradox is an ambiguous term in itself. I am signifying that the com-plex world does not reduce down to a description that is unequivocally this or that. Paradox, I am arguing, is an ontological feature of the nature of things, exacerbated by what happens at the quantum level, as I describe in ‘Smoke and mirrors’ [73].

What are the implications of this ontological paradox? A pattern may seem stable, but it is also, inevitably, a little unstable. A particular wobble or fluctuation may helpfully stabilise this particular pattern but also may contain the seeds of the pattern’s demise. There is also paradox concerning the edges of a pattern, which can be viewed as ‘here’ but may also be viewed as ‘there’.

Openness is itself [a paradox] for it enables the conditions for the vulnerability of a

system, but conversely also opens up new potentials for resilience and innovation.

Camaren Peter27



In general, in a complex world, there is no definitively ‘right way’, no definite answer, no unequivocal understanding. Life is full of inescapable paradox, ambiguity and un-certainty. The world is less concretely, unequivocally certain than we may like to hope.

Finally, I underline the systemic nature of a complex world [13]. It is only very rarely that we can reduce our descriptions of the world into separable factors whose impact is additive. The world is deeply woven together through all its aspects. This applies at all levels. For example, the formation of a star depends on a complex balance of nu-clear, magnetic and gravitational forces working on the particularities of the clouds of matter and energy that have come together at that point [4]. We cannot explain what happens by separating out these forces; we cannot ignore how their interweaving may evolve and be affected by new conditions. The world is radically systemic – that is to say, there is interweaving down to the smallest scale.

This, then, is what lies behind the model I present of process complexity, a weaving together of these seven qualities. The approach is not radically different from the view

12 Characteristically complex 59



of complexity that has come before, but there is, arguably, more emphasis on process, paradox and patterns. I have also distinguished between the conditions that lead to complexity and the characteristics of complex situations that result; as I have argued, to mix these two can be considered a ‘category error’.

In the remainder of this section, I will unpack, in turn, each of these characteristics of a process complexity ontology, underpinned by the conditions for complexity – open-ness, diversity and reflexive relationality.

In summary, then, the complex world is:

1. Systemic – pervasive, synergistically interconnected and interpenetrative,

irreducible to its parts, with qualities held systemically, not present in its

individual constituents.

2. Patterned – involving the arising, stabilising and dissolving of patterns – patterns

that intersect, patterns that self-organise; the dance between patterns and events,

the plasticity of patterns; are events really distinct from patterns?

3. Path-dependent – a world of change and flow, shaped by history and context; ‘the

path is made through walking’.

4. Particular – sensitive to context, to the specificities of the situation – which does

not mean you have to know everything.

5. Punctuated – sometimes in stasis, sometimes with tipping points, runaway change

and collapse.

6. Paradoxical – with no easy answers, no incommensurable ‘truths’ and no aspects

which can be reduced to unambiguous certainty.

7. Emergent – emergence as a systemic quality; and ‘radical emergence’ – when

radically novel qualities and characteristics appear – which have not been seen

before and could not have been predicted.

Systemic: aspects of process complexity (1)



Systemic decision-making, systemic context analysis, systemic properties as emergence, and

what’s wrong with talking about systems.



The word systemic can be interpreted in more ways than one: First, systemic applies to the complex reality of the way we make decisions.

Second, it describes how features of a society or ecology result from the complex in-terweaving of many factors.

Thirdly, the word systemic is used to label those qualities that do not reside in individ-ual parts but are characteristic of the whole.

All of these aspects is implicated within a complexity worldview.

Decision-making: I will start by looking at decision-making. Our decision-making is systemic when many different factors – social, historical, economic, ecological – weave together to create the final decision. These factors will include discrete events and chance, as well as being shaped by more established patterns and norms. Consider this example of the decision to buy a car.



The decision as to what car to buy weaves in many factors

The decision to buy a certain car will be influenced by our previous history of car owner-

ship – what we liked, what was reliable. Then there will be our budget, our colour pref-

erences, the sort of image we want to portray, the views of our family and friends, the

extent to which we are driven by our response to climate change, who else will use the

car, and so on. And even then, something that happens on the day, such as a persuasive

salesperson or a seemingly extraordinary deal, may tip the balance.



Systemic interweaving: Secondly, the same interweaving takes place in the way the characteristics of ‘place’ are formed. The fragility of a region, for example, does not just reside in its economic factors, but is also impacted by how ‘the economic’ interacts with and impacts the social, political and environmental factors, and also how the dy-namics of these interactions mutually shift and adjust over time.28 We cannot consider these aspects – social, political, economic, environmental – as separate or treat them as additive. There are synergies and antagonisms between such factors – they may mu-tually reinforce or pull apart.

Ignoring such synergies and antagonisms can negatively impact intended outcomes. Below, I explore the example of an irrigation project in Malawi, aimed at improving socioeconomic factors. In this case, the irrigation water had an unintended impact on health as it expanded the breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

62 Section II Process Complexity



Irrigation in Malawi29

The World Bank funded an irrigation scheme in Malawi, covering 40,000 hectares.

They focused on its economic and social impact but did not consider the potential im-

pact on health. The broader stretches of shallow water created breeding grounds for

malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and homes for the snail that spreads bilharzia. In 2024,

87 percent of children in this region were found to be infected with bilharzia. An ongo-

ing study is assessing the impact of this project on public health.30



Here is another example of systemic interweaving: The pandemic of 2020 resulted from many diverse factors coming together in complex ways. This had a major impact on the global economy as well as on global health, including child mental health; in developed countries it also contributed to a turn to home working and a consequent migration to more rural areas. The likelihood of a pandemic was well-recognised by epidemiologists but was outside the frame of reference of most economists; the learn-ing here is to think much more widely and systemically about the interplay of diverse factors.



The 2020 pandemic

There are many theories about the source of the virus that resulted in the COVID-19

pandemic. One of the more credible is that the pandemic was started by the transfer of

a virus from a pangolin in a market in China, and for the purposes of illustrating system-

ic thinking, I will focus on this theory.31

How did the animal come to be there? Because pangolin scales are regarded in ancient

Chinese medicine as useful for treating inflammation, there is a strong market for them.

For example, pharmaceutical companies in China are licensed to extract the relevant

substance from their scales.32 There is a conjunction between the economic (people

have money to buy pangolin extracts) and the social (a culturally shaped viewpoint, go-

ing back centuries, as to their medicinal properties). Then there is the impact of tech-

nology and wealth in the form of increased global travel; this accelerates and amplifies

the spread of such a virus, limiting the possibility of containment.

Such a global pandemic has far-reaching implications for the global economy, not to

mention on mental health, the cost of health care as well as on working practices, par-

ticularly working from home. The biggest event to impact the global economy in recent

years came from something not unknown to other disciplines, but outside the area of

interest of most economists.



Systemic emergence: Thirdly, the term systemic is also used to signify that certain qualities of the situation do not manifest in the parts but are attributes of ‘the whole’. These qualities are both everywhere and nowhere. Organisational culture is an exam-ple of such a systemic quality, something that has grown out of people’s behaviours and inter-relationships over time and has sometimes also been nudged and shaped by events. The behaviour of slime moulds, of mycelium networks, or the so-called wisdom of crowds are examples of distributed forms of intelligence – an intelligence not held

13 Systemic: aspects of process complexity (1) 63



in any one place by any single component. However, having said these qualities are attributes of ‘the whole’, that does not necessarily mean they are uniform. The culture of customer-service orientation, for example, might be stronger in some parts of the organisation than in others.

These distributed dispersed systemic qualities are often labelled as emergent. They become established only as a result of the complex interwoven interactions and inter-penetrations of the constituents. I discuss emergence and present a more comprehen-sive overview of its meaning in a later piece [19].

The last point I want to make here is that it is through the reflexive, systemic inter-weaving of factors that patterns of relationships emerge and stabilise. I will explore this process of patterning in more detail in the next piece [14].



What’s wrong with talking about systems as opposed to talking

about systemic patterns?



Finally, I want to explore why it can be unhelpful to talk about systems and why it may be preferable to talk about situations being systemic.

Bickering in Budapest



The first time I really considered the implications of the reification of systems was in 2001, at a meeting in Budapest that Peter Allen and others had arranged to discuss all things complex. This meeting was attended by Paul Cilliers, Ralph Stacey and Doug Griffin, amongst many others, and the theme was ‘The Limits of Scientific Knowledge’. My most enduring memory of the meeting was a heated exchange about the impli-cations of speaking about systems. ‘To start there,’ Stacey and Griffin emphasised, ‘is to assume a priori that the world manifests itself as systems – groups of things con-nected, with definable boundaries separating them from other systems and from their environment.’ Their point was that if we start with the idea that systems incon-trovertibly exist, then it can prejudice what we observe or experience – as we may in-advertently wish to confirm our expectations. To assume that systems exist is already to delineate the lens through which we might view what is happening and how to in-tervene. Others in the meeting, more used to modelling or designing systems, did not really see the problem.

Improving health systems



I was reminded of that moment more recently, coming across a project focused on ‘im-proving health systems’. It really struck me that a great deal was potentially wrapped up in defining the issue in that way. For example, did ‘improving health systems’ mean improving the ways a particular network of hospitals and doctors’ surgeries operate? Or did it mean improving the IT systems that allowed information to be shared? Will it 64 Section II Process Complexity



include the determinants of health – the interplay between poverty, housing, isolation, stress, addictions, mental health and so on? Will it consider improving health system-ically through looking at the interplay between public health initiatives and primary health care? Was the health system an attribute of society or of the interventions into that society? My point is that, through defining the task as ‘improving health systems’, the broader consideration of, say, health determinants is potentially exported to the wider context, even treated as ‘exogenous’, rather than seen as either central or inte-gral to the problem.



Coupling between systems?



If a society or community is sufficiently in balance that its qualities become stable and measurable, it is tempting to regard such societies or communities as ‘systems’. This legitimates, for example, talk of ‘acting on the system’ or looking to work with the couplings between systems – rather than remembering that interactions happen be-tween the constituents of the society or community – in particular, between people. While systemic qualities do emerge and may become stable, these qualities cannot be cut away from, or disentangled from, the relating, diverse, interconnected messiness out of which they emerged, and which causes them to sustain. You cannot really act on ‘the system’; you can only, in the main, impact individuals and the connections between them.

As you can see, I am wary of the word system. It suggests something that ‘exists’, some-thing that can be designed and managed, acted upon or changed.



Distinguishing between designing ways of working and describing

the ‘nature of things’



The point I am making about systems is an ontological one. I am asking whether the world tends to show up as ‘systems’, whether ‘systems’ constitute the nature of things. This is not to deny another use of the word ‘system’, to refer to the designed rules and processes of management or control. The claiming of state benefits, for example, re-quires a set of processes and rules (the management system) which clarify the required behaviours of a ‘system’ of professionals, often supported by a computer ‘system’.

It is important, therefore, to clarify whether we are discussing something designed or something innate. Designed systems will work best if they mirror the dynamics of the situation to which they will be applied. I note that management systems, often being rather mechanical in design, do not always work in the ‘real world’ in the way they were intended. This is discussed in ‘Bending the rules’ [52].



13 Systemic: aspects of process complexity (1) 65



This design language can creep across into other spheres. I feel concerned, for example, when we start to talk about ‘ecosystem services’ or even ‘economic systems’ as we run the risk of reifying concepts about the real world. For example, to call aspects of nature, ‘ecosystems services’ raises both ontological and ethical concerns. It can limit the ways we choose to explore the natural world, how we interpret what we find and what we choose to do as a result.

So, when at all possible, without tying myself in linguistic knots, I prefer to talk of the real world in terms of systemic patterns, since this feels much more tentative and ‘allowing’ than describing aspects of the social and natural world in terms of ‘systems’.





14


Patterned: aspects of process complexity (2)



The emergence, stabilising and dissolving of patterns of relationships and the role of

variation in this.



The word pattern has more than one meaning. It can signify something fixed and definite, like the repeating motifs in a knitted cardigan, or the fractal patterns in the florets of Romanesco cauliflowers. It may refer to hidden or hard-to-find patterns – such as those patterns that AI systems can extract from big data sets, that are virtually impossible to find any other way [51]. And it can signify how history – such as the rise and fall of nations or the rise and fall of dictators – often seems (almost) to repeat itself.

History never repeats itself, but it often rhymes. Mark Twain

The term pattern in the context of complexity refers to:

the systemic outcome of mutually reinforcing relationships that are temporally

or spatially situated

In many ways, I would prefer to use the word patterning to pattern.33 It conveys to an even greater degree that sense of something temporary, tentative and subjective – subject to wobblings and variation, less than definite. Qualities of patterns are depen-dent on the particularity of the way things interact and re-interact – strengthening some pathways and weakening others; these qualities are rarely entirely static. But, in order to avoid overburdening the text, I will stick in the main to the word pattern.

As I discussed in [11], for such patterns to emerge and stabilise in the complex world requires three conditions – openness to the wider environment; reflexive, reflective interactions between micro-ingredients; and diversity. Patterns may emerge out of ‘chaos’.34 They may become fairly stable and may persist, sometimes, over very long timescales. However, the reality is that they are constantly shifting and changing, due to variation, shocks, shifts in the wider environments, changes within individuals and changes in relationships. Indeed, it is these variations to the norm, these ‘micro-events’, that enable resilience and self-regulation, and lead to a relationally sustained sort of stability. And, paradoxically, this very same mechanism of variation can also destabilise patterns and cause them either to collapse or to shift into new forms with new emer-gent qualities. The very process that leads to stability ultimately leads to its collapse. This is a very interesting aspect of the processes of patterning that complexity theory brings to light.



68 Section II Process Complexity



The dynamics of pattern-forming and pattern-dissolving



In this piece, I want to bring alive the way patterns form, stabilise and self-regulate, then dissolve. This dynamic perspective on patterning is central to a processual view of complexity. The work that, in my view, best illustrates the process of pattern- forming and pattern-dissolving is that of C. S. Holling describing the life cycle of forests, as explored in Panarchy.35 I will briefly summarise this work.



The ecological life cycle: chaos – self-organisation – self-regulation – maturity –

lock-in – collapse36

Self-organisation out of chaos: Holling begins by describing a nascent forest, as it

starts to get established.

Initially, there is chaos, or randomness – no repeating connections, lots of diversity, no

sustaining forms. One part will look very much like another; there is much potential.

The nascent forest has to be open to its wider context for ‘new ingredients’ to arrive. In-

teractions, engendering the beginnings of mutual interdependency, lead to patterning.

Some of these nascent interconnecting patterns will survive and thrive, and some will

be less successful and disappear.

As the forest growth continues, its components become increasingly linked together,

and through this process, the forest evolves more ways of regulating itself and main-

taining its stability. This is a description of the self-organising process. Self-organisa-

tion is driven by chance beginnings (whatever happens to turn up in the growing forest,

what seeds birds drop, which animals wander in) and haphazard connections (shall I

eat this or eat that, can I find a place to mate here or there). Which of these new con-

nections sustains depends on how well they work (that was a good place to bring up my

young) and on what competition there is (I too want to eat that; I too want to live in that

hollow).

Self-regulation describes the process of maintaining the same basic pattern through

wobbling and shifting, that is through micro-adjustments. It is the variation between and

within the ingredients that causes the pattern to find resilience and dynamic stability

– in the face of competition and in the face of any threatening external factors. In this

way, nascent patterns start to stabilise.

Maturity and pruning: As one pattern between particular species (say the link between

soil composition, bluebells, conifers and particular insects) gets established and is suc-

cessful, other competing patterns (the wood anemone and wood sorrel) “are pruned

away”. Any new possibilities may be locked out if they cannot compete with what is al-

ready established. The diversity of species and organisms slows down and may even

decline.

Lock-in, loss of resilience and collapse: But, for the forest to be able to find resilience to

the inevitable variations that happen – due to shocks, changes in climate, availability of

nutrients, and competition for resources – it needs to find a balance between efficien-

cy and the ability to experiment with alternative pathways and patterns. This requires

‘excess diversity’, creating some ‘slack’.37 Otherwise the forest’s ever-greater efficiency

14 Patterned: aspects of process complexity (2) 69



eventually reduces its capacity to cope with severe outside shocks and it becomes “rigid

and brittle”.38 It may, indeed, reach a tipping point at which just one more small nudge

may cause collapse of form. This collapse may result in a return to chaos; or it may result

in the runaway success of one rogue species. I think of Himalayan balsam ransacking

the banks of some British rivers, wiping out all native species and then, because it dies

down to nothing in the winter, leading to their collapse – and in effect destroying the

very territory it conquered.

However, collapse is not all bad. If the ecosystem collapses, it can liberate an “enormous

potential for creativity and allow for novel and unpredictable recombination of its ele-

ments”.39 We are back to the beginning. The forest may regenerate in a new form.



But are forests identical to the social world?



I came across the above description of the life cycle of a forest a long time ago, and it was a game changer in terms of my understanding. It really brought home to me the role of variation in the establishing of reflexive and dynamically stable patterns. Varia-tion – which could be due to new ‘invaders’, new choices made by existing incumbents, or variations in the size or age of the flora or fauna – creates the wherewithal for the stabilising of mutually beneficial patterns of relationships. But variation also provides the source of its destruction.

This description of the forest captures the tension between – the dance between – di-versity and efficiency, structure and change, stability and creativity. And it emphasises the way that the ‘unit’ of interest, the unit with agency, is not the species or individual animal or plant, but the ecological pattern.

The social world is not necessarily as tidy as a forest that has been largely left to its own devices. The social world does not trot so inexorably from birth to death. If we look at social systems, differing parts of the system may be at different stages in the lifecycle; there may be certain aspects that are very locked in, such as long-standing ethnic distinctions. At the same time, there may be other aspects that are maturing and effective, such as functioning laws and systems of governance. There may be yet further aspects that are emerging and forming, like new civil society or new entrants to certain markets fuelled by opportunities created by new technology. Thus, the differ-ing lifecycle stages, undertaken in a more stepwise fashion in an isolated forest, may, in social settings, overlap, intertwine and mutually impact each other.

The self-organising propensity of societies was remarked upon by Friedrich Hayek, who said:

Purposive structures might grow up which owed little or nothing to design, which were

not invented by a contriving mind but arose from the separate actions of many men

who did not know what they were doing.40

70 Section II Process Complexity



Do we always find patterns?



It is important to recognise, however, that the world does not always show up in the form of dynamically stable patterns. Great social and environmental upheavals can also result in chaos. Equally, very controlling regimes sitting on top of ethnic dissents may display a seeming order that hides both a significant potential for disorder as well as masking some hidden patterns of resistance. Patterns can balance adaptability and efficiency – but in situations of instability or, paradoxically, in situations of tight con-trol, they will struggle to become established. The world is always complex and has a tendency to patterning – but we have to start by exploring the dynamics and norms of what is happening and not make a priori assumptions about what we might find. One can argue, indeed, that a tendency towards chaos is a not uncommon social pattern!



And are patterns really distinct from events?



One of the phrases that attracted attention from Embracing Complexity was the idea of a ‘dance between patterns and events’.41 We were using the word events to include big events – like a tsunami, and smaller events – like a new manager. There are also micro-events – such as a chance encounter, or a seemingly innocent or minor choice. Events big or small can contribute to stability and resilience. But they can also invade, as Peter Allen described it, and destabilise. There is an irresolvable paradoxical dance: too little variation or too stable a context, and we lose resilience even as we gain effi-ciency; too much variation and it may be too costly to maintain all that diversity. Equal-ly, some particular event or some large fluctuation may tip the balance and catalyse a shift into a new state.

Process complexity causes us to question whether patterns and events are really distinct. Sometimes what will destabilise the status quo is the rising of a new pattern which starts to suck energy and resources into it. This might be a new way of shop-ping or a new emerging galaxy which devours matter from nearby constellations. The ‘event’ of a new pattern can shift the existing pattern.

Maybe it is more accurate to think about large patterns and small patterns – or long-lived or more fleeting patterns – than to speak about patterns and events as if they are necessarily different in kind.



A new CEO – pattern or event?

The arrival of a new CEO will constitute an event to an organisation. But in truth, the

new boss does not come unencumbered. Maybe she is part of a network known for new

ideas and ways of working, and this is why she was chosen? The CEO will inevitably

be part of other social patternings – family, community and peer group – and will

carry these wider connections with her when she is at work. Should she be construed

as an ‘event’ acting on the organisation, or is the new boss better thought of as an

aspect of pre-existing, intersecting social patterns that engage with the patterning of the

organisation she is joining in a way that changes and shifts and re-shifts all of them?

14 Patterned: aspects of process complexity (2) 71



So, the description of the shaping of the future as a ‘dance between patterns and events’ can be extended and reframed, in a processual view, as a dance between long patterns and short patterns, or indeed between long events and short events. Not as catchy though! It is intriguing to find that Rovelli, in the field of quantum gravity [6], and Ames and Hall describing the cosmology of Daoism [23], make very similar statements.

In similar vein, Dupré, discussing the nature of organisms in Everything Flows: towards a processual theory of biology, states that: “An organism, whatever else it may be, is an event – something happening.”42



In summary



I have covered rather a lot of ground in this piece. First, I discussed the primacy of dynamically stable patterns of relationships, which draw their stability from a level of variation and a degree of natural selection in the reflexive relationships that become established. Complex, mutual, reflexive interactions at the granular micro-level can create relatively stable forms or patterns at the macro-level.

Then, through working with the life cycle of the forest, I explored how patterns may change over time and may, under certain conditions, become rigid and less resilient to shocks.

Finally, I considered, in line with a processual view of complexity, that there is no real categorizable distinction between patterns and events.

Prigogine was intrigued by the emerging patterns in particular chemical mixes. I devel-op, in [11], the example of how the patterns of relationships and norms of behaviour derive in families. We find similar patterns of interaction and dependence in ecologies – at the level of forests, oceans or organisms. The universe of galaxies is patterned. The brain is patterned in its repeating neural networks, leading to sustained patterns of thinking [44]. We find patterning in societal and organisational cultural norms, in pow-er relations, and in beliefs.

Patterns, I am arguing, constitute our world, and articulating the way in which patterns form and dissolve provides a powerful narrative of change.

Path-dependent: aspects of process complexity (3)



Exploring the dynamics of past, present and future and considering the meaning behind ‘the

path is made through walking’.

We need to explore how the past shaped the present and how the present is

co-responsible for the future. Kurt Richardson and Paul Cilliers43



The future is dependent on what happens on the way; that hardly seems like a con-troversial statement. The future does not follow smoothly from the present, can-not be predicted, and is shaped but not determined by the particularities of history and context. The future is also impacted by chance events. Thorstein Veblen, in Why isn’t Economics an Evolutionary Science, written in 1898, coined the phrase “dispassionate cumulative causation” to express the nature of this process.44

In this piece, I want to unpick various aspects of path dependency: the role of expecta-tions, the impact of chance, the weaving together of history, context, events, choices and values, and the way the ‘path is made through walking’.45 If the future is co-created, then, as Paul Cilliers argued, ethics imbues everything.



Envisaging path-dependency

Sometimes, in teaching these ideas, I share a picture of a large wave breaking on the

shore. I ask: ‘What creates the shape of that particular wave, and determines the way it

breaks at that particular time?’ Students find it easy to recall many of the features that

have an impact – the phase of the moon, water temperature, the slope of the beach, the

wind, the time of the year. But they often fail to include two other important factors:

one is history and the second is the role of chance. Regarding history, maybe there was

a tsunami two days earlier across the ocean, or an iceberg collapsed hundreds of miles

away? Such historical events will have an impact on the shape of that wave that combine

with the impact of the local conditions and the gravitational pull of the moon.

With respect to chance, maybe two seconds before the wave was about to break, a

whale surfaced, or a submarine?

The outcome depends on the complex weave of all these factors coming together. So,

path-dependency is not as simple as a series of logical causal steps as encapsulated in

the saying “for want of a nail, the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost”. It

is multi-factorial, intertwined and complex!



74 Section II Process Complexity



The role of the imagination



It is interesting to consider that path-dependency is also impacted by what we imagine about the future. I like the following quote, by Prigogine.

In living systems, the behaviour at a given time is partly determined by memory and

partly by the anticipation of the future. … In this sense, the future contributes to the

present.46



However, sometimes the need to respond rapidly to situations can make it very dif-ficult to pursue intended goals and intentions; decisions, in some circumstances, are primarily determined by immediate concerns, and the vision of the desired future holds little sway. The following example – considering the actual journeys taken by asylum seekers, and how these differ from the expectations of both themselves and policy makers – illustrates the point.



The path-dependent process of asylum seekers47

The decision-making of asylum seekers starts in their imagination some time before

their departure – the hoped-for new life as seen on the movies or infused with the de-

scriptions of those already in their new country (who might be exaggerating to cover

up their shame of not living a successful life). Would-be asylum seekers are also af-

fected by the motivations of their families, wanting someone – often a young male –

to pioneer the way, and be able to send for others.

As they travel, their decision-making is constrained by their evolving situation, and is

often adaptive, impacted by ‘rapidly evolving circumstances’ requiring ‘rapid evidence

assessment’. Their emerging trajectory is a complex weave of factors – chance encoun-

ters with smugglers or with other migrants, weather, sudden opportunities, health and

money. Evidence suggests that their choice of destination will change many times on

the way; evidence also shows that the policies of the country to which they are headed

appear to have little impact. What has greatest impact is the hearsay swapped between

travelling migrants and the sometimes ‘talked up’ stories of those who have arrived at

their destination.

This has an interesting implication for government policies in relation to migrants. Such

policies can often seem based on stereotypical, dehumanising views of asylum seekers,

seeing them as ‘undesirable’, or as selfish in that they are trying to ‘jump the queue’. Re-

search suggests that government policy and the behaviour of migrants is largely decou-

pled, and governments seem to base policies on inaccurate notions of how policy might

deter them.



The impact of events



The story of asylum seekers illustrates the impact of chance events.

15 Path-dependent: aspects of process complexity (3) 75



Chance events can be hugely influential in shaping the future. For example, in 1348, the plague in the UK killed off so many serfs that, as a result, farm workers were able to demand better conditions and be released from serfdom. This catalysed a huge shift in social and economic patterns. History is conditioned in this way; certain events or fac-tors shift the conditions, which can allow something not previously possible to happen.

Adam Moore explores this theme. He explains, in The Eventfulness of Social Reproduc-tion, that some social scientists theorise that there are periods of structural stabili-ty followed by significant events that may radically change things. He, in resonance with the complexity perspective, sees structure and events not as sequential but as co-evolving. Moore says:

Casting structure and events as irreconcilable opposites does not lead to an explana-

tion of how events can effect change in social structures, or, in turn, how the outcome

of events is impacted by the structures they transform. Moore48



This ‘dance between patterns/structures and events’ is discussed further in [14].



There is more than one future, but not an infinite number; the

‘path is made through walking’



Peter Allen used to unsettle people back in the day by asserting that there is more than one future. I am not quite sure why people found this so upsetting other than it is another recognition of the limits to determinism. He was suggesting that, whilst the past constrains and shapes the future, the future is nevertheless not fixed. There is another way to say this: When things happen, when “possibilities become actualities”49 then some future possibilities become unavailable. Stuart Kauffman refers to this nar-rowing of options as non-ergodicity, discussed in [8]. In choosing to live in the south, or study this subject not that, I shape and constrain my future options. The future is not an open-ended flat terrain where anything is possible, but a terrain that is shaped along the way by what we and others choose.

To put it another way, the future is co-created. The path both shapes and is shaped by actions, intentions, chances, choices and everything that happens along the way. The Buddhist version of this is the idea of karma.50 Daoists say that ‘the path is made through walking’.51

I particularly like the notion that ‘the path is made through walking’. I think it contains the heart of what path-dependency is about. First, I join a path that has been made through the walking others have done before me. Second, I don’t make the path alone – I am affected by the ‘footsteps’ of others around me. Third, the future path will follow on from where we have got to, and the future trajectory will be constrained by the path already taken, and yet is still open to possibilities. Fourth, something unexpected might happen – a boulder arrives out of the blue which destroys part of the path and chang-es the game. The point is, that there is no certain path already laid down that we can merely follow.

76 Section II Process Complexity



We experience what Catherine Keller, in On the Mystery,52 calls ‘creative freedom’ – but our freedom is constrained by the current conditions.

If the world is an open-ended process of interactions, it is because we may exercise

choice in the way we influence each other’s becomings and the way we shape our own

becoming out of the manifold of influences. We are indelibly marked by our past. We

cannot escape the process of being influenced and of influencing. But we may exercise

creative freedom within it. Keller53



The implications of path dependency: seed the system with good

ingredients?



The end cannot justify the means for the simple and obvious reason that the means

employed determine the nature of the ends produced. Aldous Huxley

If our collective actions shape the future for us all, what does that mean for personal practice? Paul Cilliers, in particular, thought deeply about the implications of path de-pendence; for him, it brought attention to the issue of ethical choice [32]. Building on Huxley’s famous quote, we cannot just say that the end justifies the means because what we do on the way – the means – determines the end. If we make choices – say to lie – in order to achieve an end, the lie enters the system. Was it worth it? We still can’t be sure if ‘the lie’ will achieve what we set out to achieve, but the lie plays a role in co-creating the future norms of those it impacts. For Cilliers, path-dependency and the impossibility of determining the future highlighted the importance of acting ethi-cally. Every choice, in his view, is a moral choice. Regimes that condone the murder of civilians tend to become regimes that lock-in the condoning of the murder of civilians. Murdering civilians will have an impact on the culture whether or not the desired out-come, the reason for murdering civilians, is achieved.



Lock-in



There is one final and very important issue to raise and that is lock-in. This is a theme I explore in some detail in ‘Who got the power?’ [70]. History shows us how the accumu-lation of power or wealth can shape society in such a way that things become very hard to change, as discussed in ‘The dynamics of pattern-forming and pattern-dissolving’ in [14]. This is called historical institutionalism.54 However, no matter how locked-in situations become, history also shows us that things do change, even if that change is, initially, into collapse. Path dependency from a complexity perspective is always a weaving together of the impacts of the past, together with the impact of changes in the wider environment, together with chance, fluctuations and choice. We may look back and gain a sense of the path that has emerged, but the future is less easy to determine.

15 Path-dependent: aspects of process complexity (3) 77



In conclusion



The term path-dependency signifies the way the past shapes but does not determine the present, and the way the present limits but does not determine the future. It allows for the way events or changes may ‘invade’ existing patterns and norms and so cause them to shift or collapse. It emphasises that change and stasis do not follow sequentially, one after the other, but are intertwined, woven together. As Prigogine pointed out, it is easy to want stability to last and focus on its attributes in a ‘scientific’ manner, while banishing instability to the historical study of key events and key ‘men’.55

We may want to “cast structure and events as irreconcilable opposites”56 – but in real-ity, they are not.





16


Particular: aspects of process complexity (4)



The particularity of detail has an impact on what happens. But when patterns stabilise,

we do not need to know all the detail to get to grips with what is there. However, it is also

important to pay attention to any minute signs of emerging change.



One aspect of the processual worldview that is implicit in what has been covered so far is the importance of the particularity of history and context. The particular ingredients and the particular sequence of events and relationships that have led the local present is material to which ‘present’ has emerged. There is sensitivity to context, to the availability or not of diverse ingredients, to chance and to subtle variations. If this particularity is averaged out statistically, as discussed in ‘The raw and the cooked’ [31], we can become blind to the very mechanisms that have co-created what is here, and which shape how it might change. The process of change is fundamentally deter-mined by this very detail, the ‘minute particulars’; what is there, how did it get there, how do and did things interact, what patterns of relationships have emerged, how stable are they, and how might they be destabilised?

He who would do good to another must do it in minute particulars: general Good is the

plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer, for art and science cannot exist but in

minutely organised particulars. William Blake

Attention to particularity can sound menacing, as it can seem to suggest that we need to know everything about everything before we can act. But in practice, what tends to emerge from the process of reflexive interactions between things, are patterns and forms. These patterns and forms can be relatively stable and require relatively few pa-rameters (compared to the number of the micro-elements out of which they are con-stituted) to capture their qualities. For example, if I want to describe the culture of an organisation – considered as a patterning of relationships – then I can probably do that well enough in half a dozen words. I don’t need to know what everyone is doing or thinking at all times. This accords with our experience of the world, a world which we often find relatively stable and predictable. Indeed, sometimes the world seems so fixed that we despair of anything ever changing. For some of us, at least, life is not in general chaotic or random.

Having said that, there are, of course, many places where chaos is the norm; my news-paper alerts me to that every day. Engaging with any situation requires an understand-ing of the particular dynamics at play. It is worth noting that even where there is chaos, it is likely that there will remain some familial and social patterns that provide some coherence.

80 Section II Process Complexity



Things start here and now



One of the core tenets of complexity theory is that what emerges has its roots in the ‘here and now’. This was at the heart of Darwin’s insights – that evolution is initiated by a particular situation. To give an example: It was on a particular pond, on a particular Tuesday afternoon that Fred the frog was born with longer legs than his siblings. If this gives Fred an advantage over his rivals and he ‘gets the girls’, then this may trigger the beginnings of a change to the frog population. If these long-legged frogs also have an advantage in other places too, places where conditions are not necessarily the same, then such a change might spread and become established.

The point is that what emerges more globally starts with the local. Darwin catalysed a change to the way science was understood; science, prior to Darwin, tended to focus on universal laws and predictability. This recognition of the power of the particular changed the game; this is discussed in more detail in ‘Unity and uniqueness’ [5] and in ‘Darwin and evolution’ [7].



Systems versus complexity perspectives



One of the imputations that might be levelled at systems perspectives, rather than complexity perspectives, is that systems perspectives tend to preference the getting to grips with current patterns of relationships and place emphasis on methods to achieve that. This can lead us to infer that if we understand present patterns, this will provide a good grasp on what might unfold in the future.

Those working with complexity perspectives do also focus on patterns of relationships but are just as interested in spotting any signs of instability or signs of newness. Com-plexity theory does not, as a general rule, indicate that the present is a good indicator of the future. The complexity practitioner is looking out for relatively stable patterns, which can often be described using relatively few terms, but at the same time is look-ing for signs of impending instability and nascent change. Attuning to early signs of change is a subtle process compared with recognising, describing and defining current relatively stable patterns [27]. This movement in attention – between what is stable and what is unstable, between what is established and what is new – is the stuff of complexity.

Much of the practice implied by embracing complexity – be it research, strategy development, change, impact assessment or ‘living well’ – requires an approach contingent on circumstances. The future depends on the particularities of the situation. This is explored in detail in Section VII(c).

Punctuated: aspects of process complexity (5)



The nonlinear ‘lumpiness’ of change, change can happen in ‘fits and starts’.



Process complexity points to a certain non-uniform ‘lumpiness’ or texturing in the processual evolving of social and natural systems. There are times of relative sta-

sis, and there are times of incremental drift, when not much happens. There are other times when there is a shift into something radically, and irreversibly new. This accords with the idea of punctuated equilibrium, proposed by palaeontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.57 Punctuated equilibrium describes the way that that evo-lution occurs in spurts – in ‘fits and starts’.58 There are long periods of relative stability with little activity in terms of extinctions or the emergence of new species, interrupted by intermittent bursts of activity.

This idea fits very well with complexity thinking, which emphasises that change is nat-urally episodic,59 and occurs at irregular intervals. A ‘tipping point’ is the name given to the juncture at which there is the start of significant change, one that results, ultimate-ly, in a new era. It often signifies a so-called ‘regime shift’,60 whereby the qualities and characteristics after the tip are substantially different from those before; new prop-erties have emerged [19]. The regime shift is not always contained or smooth; there may be runaway change, as in the take-off of a pandemic, or there may be collapse. These are also likely to be nonlinear effects – small changes can lead to exponential outcomes, as discussed further in [67].

There are a few warnings to make here: Talking of tipping points can place all our at-tention on the ‘straw that broke the camel’s back’, to use a rather unattractive image. A sandpile seems stable until the point when one last grain of sand tips the balance and results in a cascade. There is a danger, though, in focusing on the ‘final straw’ or ‘last grain’ rather than on the conditions that led up to it. If we want to engender stability, we need to pay attention much earlier as to whether the system as a whole is becoming less diverse, more rigid, and less resilient. We also need to notice whether there are new factors appearing which might take hold.

Climate scientists, for example, have been warning of the effects of greenhouse gases since at least the 1960s. Scientists such as Rachel Carson61 recognised that the eco-logical picture as a whole, the systemic interweaving of many factors, was pointing towards irreversible climate change. She and others were advising that early interven-tion could prevent the arrival of that point of no return, when it becomes too late to reverse warming – a point which many scientists now fear we are already past.

One of the problems with nonlinear, episodic, punctuated change – and I discuss this in more detail in ‘Run, run, runaway’ [67] – is that we Western-educated citizens have a tendency to cling to the notion of an incremental, linear world. We do not, on some level, really believe that the status quo won’t go on forever. We behave as if we believe 82 Section II Process Complexity



that, if there is a little bit too much climate change, we can just reverse it by switching off the oil for a while or doing a bit more recycling. However, attuning ourselves to the idea of radical, irreversible change may be fundamental to our survival.



Nonlinear change may signify that a new ingredient is entering

the mix



There is a telling paragraph in Embracing Complexity couched in the language of non- linearity.62 Here we point out that if an existing balance between two factors in connection starts to change, this will be viewed as a nonlinear relationship emerging between the two things. But – and this is the key point – what it often signifies is not that there is a change in relationship between the things we knew were there, but that some new ingredient is entering into the mix.



Tipping points versus fluctuations



Another issue to consider is that we cannot be sure, until later, that we have really gone through a tipping point and entered a new regime. We cannot always tell the dif-ference between a fluctuation that, in the end, did not catch on, and one that may be-come more permanent. Sometimes only time will tell.

It is like waking up with a sore throat. Is this evidence of the beginning stages of a cold, or will it resolve over the course of the day? This argument has been used in question-ing climate change. Is what we are experiencing a real shift, or just a bit of a fluctuation in the climate metrics? Unfortunately, as I write this in 2024, the evidence of unprec-edented shifts in temperature, ice cover, salination, and extreme weather events con-veys such a compelling picture that only the very determined would now be able to refute it.

Punctuated equilibrium reminds us that while complex interweaving is always occur-ring, there remain periods when everything appears fixed and stable. We can, during these stable periods, be prone to taking them for granted. During periods of stasis, we find that we are able to identify the stable and often almost linear causal links through using standard analytical tools. We gain confidence as we successfully predict the out-come of a new intervention or investment strategy. Classical economics was built on the idea that economies only shift incrementally from stability, and hence modelling them in times of stability, as with stable systems in classical physics, can be effective. Models, it is true, can work well during periods of locked in stability.

So, what is the problem? The problem, in part, is that we appear to be living in an age of turbulence, where change in very many aspects of planetary life – economic, polit-ical, health, climate – is fast and furious. So, any appearance of stability is likely to be short-lived. Secondly, if stability has been artificially held in place through hierarchy or

17 Punctuated: aspects of process complexity (5) 83



fear or minimising diversity and adaptability, conditions can be particularly prone to sudden change.

It is also easy to be lulled into complacency when models seem to be working well and are providing seemingly reliable predictions. This may cause us to take our eye off the ball, and hence we may miss any signs of emerging instability or fail to notice new fac-tors starting to take hold. We may become blind to those very conditions and factors that lead towards the tipping into new regimes.

The strategist who merely optimises the present and is taken by surprise at unexpect-ed radical shifts, is never going to change the world. Conversely, those strategists who spot gaps and opportunities, nascent shifts in current behaviours, and emerging signs that there are untapped niches – these are the people who ride with the waves, and who identify and amplify any favourable conditions that are starting to reveal them-selves [56].





18


Paradoxical: aspects of process complexity (6)



Exploring why paradox is such a central feature of a complex world.



A paradox, according to Wikipedia, is a logically self-contradictory statement, one that runs contrary to one’s expectation. Para doxa is translated as ‘against common sense’. It usually signifies that there are conflicting-yet-interrelated aspects of a situa-tion that exist simultaneously and persist over time.

Carlo Rovelli and Chris Clarke bring the idea of paradox right back to the level of the quantum. The thought experiment, Schrödinger’s Cat63 – which describes the idea that the mythical ‘quantum cat’ can be both alive and dead – is one expression that brings paradox to life and shows that the physical world incorporates paradox at its core [73].

In the complex world, there are many situations which display a quality of paradoxical incommensurability, whereby two or more opposing factors may be existent and per-tinent at the same time. So, in a process complexity perspective, we are often handling the co-existence of incompatible opposites. And this is at the level of ontology; para-dox is an aspect of ‘the way things are’ – an aspect of existence, not just a feature of the difficulties of knowing or engaging with the world. The distinction between ontology and epistemology is discussed in ‘Metaphysics and chocolate’ [2].

Ecologies, organisations, communities and indeed galaxies contain paradoxical quali-ties in many ways. They display both structure and variation, are both stable and un-stable, both fixed and flowing. Their future is neither random nor certain. Boundaries are not merely a matter of opinion, nor are they objectively existent. Patterns of rela-tionships meld into the wider world and yet have a degree of definition. There needs to be variation in order to create stability, but that same variation may catalyse instabili-ty. These are examples of the paradoxical stuff of the processual complex world.

Paradox implies there are no easy answers. Indeed, it implies there are no right answers that can be found through logical analysis of definitive data, in part as data itself – in-deed the world itself – is ontologically paradoxical. Many situations are a conundrum; it all depends.

Many of the pieces I include further on in this book look at the implications for practice of the paradox that is at the heart of the complexity ontology. How does this impact ‘ways of knowing’ [Section V]? Should we, for example, use what Goethe called ‘con-templative knowing’ [40]? What does embracing paradox mean for how to engender change [57] or how to approach politics or governance [70]? How, for example, do we find ways to trade off freedom and responsibility or – even more complex – liberty, equality and fraternity? Can we find ways of going beyond the logical mind, allowing a more integrative, subjective engagement with the situation [37]? Working ‘critically’ 86 Section II Process Complexity



with others, grappling with many perspectives can facilitate fresh insights, and novel ‘out of the box’ solutions [36].

There is a fundamental irreducibility to reality that we can never dispel … reality is lost

by being abstracted. Camaren Peter64



I describe in ‘Polarities, paradox and the middle ground’ [60] an approach to working with polar opposites and encouraging a ‘third way’ to emerge – a sort of transcend-ing, both-and integrative insight or outcome. This contemplative process is where ‘mystery’ can enter, the crack in the logic which allows the light in, to misquote Leonard Cohen. This is not a compromise, not merely a question of finding a mid-point between opposites; it is the surfacing of something excitingly, radically ‘new’. This is known as Hegel’s dialectic: “An interpretive method in which the contradiction between a prop-osition and its antithesis is resolved at a higher level of truth”.65

This process of transcendence is based on what Plato called the “logic of the included middle”.66 As Camaren Peter puts it, “there will be fundamentally irresolvable, ‘unde-cidable’ factors that occupy the territory of the middle”.67 In other words, you can’t find a way to resolve irresolvable differences through ‘absolute’ logic and analysis.

The present knows no absolutes, only uniqueness. Peter68



Peter continues: “[The solution] requires learning, participation, integration and negotiation, i.e., strategies that engage directly with the contextual specificities … and which can possibly lead to their resolution … under certain context-specific condi-tions.”69 Clarke, referring to quantum physics, calls this context-specific logic [73].

The point is that we have to tussle with these paradoxes and not rescue ourselves by flipping to one pole or another. Anyone can build an efficient organisation that works like a machine; anyone can build a flexible, fluid, adaptable organisation ready for anything. But to find a way both to be able to survive now and have the capacity and breadth to succeed into the future is much harder [59]. The aim is not to find a compro-mise, but to allow the paradox to act as ‘grit in the oyster’ so that a new kind of solution can surface.

Much more could be said about paradox. I refer you to Chris Mowles’ book Managing in Uncertainty: Complexity and the Paradoxes of Everyday Organisational Life.70

One must not think ill of paradox, for paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinking

without the paradox is like the lover without passion … the ultimate paradox of thought

[is] to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think. Søren Kierkegaard

Emergent: aspects of process complexity (7)



Exploring different aspect of the meaning of emergence.



Finally, there is emergence, and I’ve left the trickiest until last. Emergence is a term deployed in many different ways. It is used colloquially and

loosely to mean that something new has appeared – as in ‘light emerged out of dark-ness’. It can also signify qualities that are systemic – not present in individual parts [13]. The classic example is the wetness of water. Wetness is a systemic property that is not characteristic of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of which it is constituted; wetness is often described as an emergent property.

In this piece, I want to deconstruct the idea of emergence. I consider the way systemic properties are sometimes reversible and sometimes not; I also suggest that emergence is not necessarily systemic. And I describe the notion of radical emergence. Emergence is complex!



Emergence equated with systemic properties



Many self-organised patterns that have become stabilised and in balance will have sys-temic qualities; the particular qualities depend on the particular way the ingredients which make them have combined. Another arrangement of the same ingredients could lead to different systemic qualities.

Let me give an example: Imagine a group coming together for the first time to trek across Greenland. Over a few days, friendships will be made, and routines, habits and a sort of ‘culture’ will be established. If weather conditions change rapidly and there is a crisis, things may change as a result. After the crisis, will the ‘old’ culture be re-estab-lished, or will the crisis have irreversibly changed the norms?

The shifts in relationships between the trekkers as a response to the weather allowed a different culture (a systemic property) to emerge in the trekking group. There are no new ‘ingredients’ – but one culture emerged, then another took over, and maybe a third might result at a later stage.

The culture of a group, as Gregory Bateson points out, is likely to have a normalis-ing effect on individuals and impact future behaviour. The ‘manners’ or norms of the group are sensed by individuals and play a role in shaping their and the group’s future behaviour.71

88 Section II Process Complexity



There are many examples of such systemic behaviour in the natural world too. The flocking behaviour seen in murmurations, the way slime moulds navigate a maze in search of food, the behaviour of ants and bees – all these are examples of collective behaviour whereby ‘intelligence’ emerges in the aggregate.

There are a couple of points that I want to raise about equating emergence with systemic qualities.

Let me use murmurations to make the first point; the emergent qualities of these mur-murations do not substantially change as the birds swirl around the sky, and there are no radical differences between murmurations. The nature of the movement is constrained and is recognisable; there are no surprises. This is similar to water; once you’ve experi-enced that water is wet, it is no longer a revelation.

The second point is exemplified by ants. Ants can display different modes of behaviour; if they are responding to a threat rather than to a new food source, for example, the pattern of behaviour is markedly different. However, these changes are reversible; the ants will return to ‘feeding mode’ or ‘reproducing mode’ when the threat is passed.

In my mind, the systemic qualities displayed by ants and murmuring birds – qualities that exist only in the collective – are a weak form of emergence in that they remain within expected limits.

However, things are not always like this. There are also situations when things tip irreversibly into a new regime and radical new systemic properties emerge. For example, there is a substantial difference between the qualities of snow when it first falls, and when it has partially melted and refrozen. These are irreversible shifts in the systemic qualities of the snow; the snow cannot return to how it was.



Emergence that is not systemic



The examples described thus far are all examples – some reversible, some not revers-ible – of emergence as a description of systemic properties held by the whole. However, to muddy the waters, emergent properties, in my view, are not always systemic.

For example, in a society where power is in the hands of the few, there may emerge dis-tinct groups who lead very different lives. A small group – let’s say of the fabulously rich and powerful – may emerge. But in this example, emergence is not, I would argue, a col-lective, systemic feature of the whole. However, the emergence of a new group, or new technology or new habit may ultimately lead to systemic change as discussed below.



Radical emergence



I’m now going to make things even more complicated and introduce what Stuart Kauffman calls radical emergence.72 Radical emergence can occur in situations when

19 Emergent: aspects of process complexity (7) 89



there is an addition or subtraction to the ‘dimensions’ of the problem – such as a new technology, or the extinction or exodus of some of the ‘ingredients’. This change to the ‘dimensions’ can re-engineer the whole landscape, and out of this a novel future with novel features can emerge. What this future state looks like cannot be known in ad-vance – and could not have been imagined or predicted from the perspective of the previous state. Clayton Christensen describes this as the outcome of disruptive inno-vation; we enter into a world of ‘unknown unknowns’.73

Kauffman and Brian Arthur74 point out that sometimes something is created for one reason – such as the internet – and yet catalyses radical shifts in many other ways – global communication, home working, education, parenting, friendship and so on. The same can be said of the impact on longer-term societal norms of the pandemic of 2020.

In the complex world, the possibility that the future may emerge as novel, surprising, and unknowable is a central factor. New ‘dimensions’ in situations open to the wider world are always a possibility. Think of a sea in which nutrients arrive through a shift in ocean currents, or ships bring pollution, or sharks move further north due to climate change. These new factors facilitate the ‘radical emergence’ of new behaviours never before seen.

Initially, such features may not be systemic, as with the social impact of powerful in-dividuals. But over time, such emergent features may become features of the whole.



A taxonomy of emergence



So, to summarise:

First, the term emergence is often used to refer to the properties of systems or groups that are held systemically and not displayed at the level of the individual components. The particular nature of the systemic properties may shift reversibly with conditions (like the trekkers in Greenland) and sometimes shift irreversibly (like snow).

Second, there are situations in which a distorting influence, like the power of key lead-ers or the behaviour of a dominant firm, leads to new factors that, at least initially, are not overarching or systemic.

Third, new factors entering the situation, such as a new technology, may ‘change the game’ and lead to radically new systemic properties never before seen or imagined, and impossible to predict.



End note: processual emergence



After I thought I had finished this piece, I woke up the next morning with an addition-al thought. What about those situations when something collective grips a crowd, something that seems suddenly to appear out of nowhere? Isn’t that an example of 90 Section II Process Complexity



emergence? I am imagining the point at which a crowd turns violent, or when a flock of animals on the African savanna smells danger, stiffens and then bolts as one. I remem-ber a not dissimilar experience on a management course at 3 a.m., when everyone had stayed up all night to design and build a factory as part of a competitive simulation. Suddenly, after bickering most of the night, the group pulled together and started to act as one unit. Musicians or singers who jam together have this experience too.



Community building

Morgan Scott Peck developed an approach to community building.75 About fifty people

gather together for a weekend to learn about how communities cohere; there are no

particular instructions. Scott Peck notes that such a group goes through distinct stages:

At first, the more extrovert makes speeches, and the quieter ones sit impassive. Then

people may become annoyed and talk over each other and disagree. Next there can be

a sort of empty silence that descends. Finally, it is as if something sparks the group and

a new sense of connection may engulf the participants – a collective resolve, a shared

connection, an ease.

I remember a particular weekend when I was party to this. It was very profound, and

that moment has remained with me, decades later.



Both ‘jamming’ and this kind of community building result in a form of systemic emer-gence – but one enabled and extended by the interacting of people who have loosened their ego boundaries and defensive separation; they are allowing the possibility of a shared connection to be woven more deeply. This ‘allowing’ goes beyond deliberate intent; it is more unconscious.

As some political writers have noted [70], this sort of shared deep connection between people is often brought to the fore when resisting repressive regimes or campaigning together for a shared belief. So, what emerges when we connect at a deeper level – the nature of the new behaviour – is, arguably, different in kind from that which emerg-es when people in a group remain distant and polite. I am going to call this processual emergence as it occurs when we humans act more like porous interwoven ‘processes’ – more like ripples – than individual units. The inference is that something more pro-found and transformative can emerge if we release our tight hold on our sense of self, allow boundaries to soften, and connect more deeply with each other and with the wider world.

Recently, a colleague sent me a paper by Otto Scharmer and Eva Pomeroy, and I re-alised that my musings about processual emergence chime with their description of “trans-subjective knowing”. This is a knowing that we experience, via the “social field” as “coming through us but is not of us”.76 I am enticed to dig further [36].



19 Emergent: aspects of process complexity (7) 91



And so …



There is much to say about emergence, and I hope, in a sense, you are a little confused. Emergence is one of those concepts that it is easy to imagine you’ve ‘got’ when, in fact, it is layered with meaning and evades capture. I never feel quite satisfied with what I read or write about emergence, and I welcome that, as it keeps me observing and re-flecting on experience and stops me putting emergence in a box of ‘mastered concepts’ to take out every so often to polish.





Section III




Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?





20


Introducing Daoist cosmology: a better way?



Introducing Daoism as a process philosophy, the background to the Dao de Jing and its

purpose in exploring leadership and the ‘cultivation of character’.



Daoism (or Taoism) emerged in China in the fourth or fifth century B.C.E. and, simply put, adopts a cosmology that is very resonant with that of process complexity. I

cannot really point to any substantive differences between the two except that Dao-ism goes a bit further and embraces some concepts better developed in quantum phys-ics than in complexity. I continue to find this astounding.

The Dao de Jing, the core book of Daoism, is attributed to Lao Tzu, who was an elder contemporary of Confucius, although little is known about him, and there is a strong possibility that he never really existed.1 The text was most likely derived from a much earlier oral tradition and may have been assembled from the work of many authors.2

I first came across the Dao de Jing in my teens, but I re-discovered it in 2003, as I explain in the Introduction, when Peter Allen returned from London to Cranfield clutching a new translation and commentary by Roger Ames and David Hall.3 Peter was amazed at how closely Daoist cosmology resembled that of complexity. That was, for me, the starting point of what has become a twenty-year dialogue with this text. Its evocative and poetic [39] nature, its paradoxes and obscurities, its exhortation to become my best self has led me along a quest for meaning that is as much contemplative as cog-nitive. It requires a right-brained, imaginative sort of engagement [45]. My occasional flurries of insight accord me great pleasure.

The Dao de Jing is grounded in a naturalistic metaphysics [2], derived from lived ex-perience – from being immersed in the world and being a part of that world. The Daoists developed their cosmology by being present to their lives and surroundings, by attending to the consequences of actions and inactions. This is a phenomenologi-cal4 approach. It is not a view created from constructed stories or theories concern-ing the heavens or the gods, or a creation out of chaos. Nor does it imagine a world made of building blocks, or a world unfolding on its allotted path towards its intended destination.

The Dao de Jing, however, does not merely give voice to Daoist metaphysics. Its meta-physical position also provides the basis of an exploration of leadership, ethics, strat-egy, harmony, and skilful living. The aim is to help us cultivate ‘character’, a “quality of character that makes this world itself a better place”.5

In this section, I want to bring alive the Daoist cosmology. Then, I want to explore what this might mean for practice. My reasons for doing this are threefold.

96 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



First, the way certain scholars have written about the Dao de Jing brings great depth, colour and nuance to its core tenets. These core tenets are not alien to complexity thinkers, but the Dao de Jing has a way of expressing them that engages me at a deeper level. Any shifts in perspective I make seem more embodied. Compare ‘be authentic’ with “Display a genuineness like raw silk”;6 or ‘things only manifest in relationships’ with “There is no view from nowhere, no external perspective, no separate vantage point; we are all in the soup.”7

Secondly, if the Daoists, nearly two and a half thousand years ago, reached similar con-clusions to modern complexity thinkers about ‘the way the world works’, I feel vali-dated in my conviction to ‘embrace complexity’. It cements my view that complexity thinking has something vital to offer the world.

Thirdly, there is much expressed in the Dao de Jing about how to live well in this flowing, changing, contextually sensitive world. These insights had been honed over centuries and provide a rich source of encouragement. They are worth contemplating. I have also been intrigued that very similar ideas turn up in contemporary texts on politics or so-cial change, from people who have lived through complex times and experienced how change actually happens [70].

With regard to Daoism, I have studied primarily the work of Ames and Hall. In my view, they explain convincingly why Daoism takes this very engaged, contextual, relational, subjective and path-dependent view of change – a processual worldview. Although I preference their work, I do also consult that of other scholars, for example philosopher and sinologist François Jullien,8 Chinese poet and translator David Hinton9 and sinolo-gist Michael Puett.10 There are other Daoists texts too, specifically The Zhuangzi11 and The Art of War.12 Both of these books further illuminates and contextualises the key philosophical concepts and offer suggestions for practice.

In this focus on Daoist cosmology, I want to bring to the fore the actual language used both in the Dao de Jing and its associated commentaries. I would like to enable you, the reader, to meet the work head on, not overly sanitised and mediated by me. So, I have included many quotes and referrals to commentaries, more than in any other part of this book. Ames and Hall do use quite intricate language, and I feel I have gained a great deal by grappling with it, by reading and cogitating and re-reading. It demands effort, but I have resisted the offer of a sound-bite version, and I hope you enjoy the tussle. Roger Ames was, at the time of writing, still lecturing, and I found a recording13 which I really enjoyed, so I recommend that too.

Ames and Hall explain that the Dao de Jing itself was written more as a series of par-able, as devices to make the reader think, than as an explanation or compendium of answers. As they explain, the relationship between the text and its student is one of “non-coercive collaboration”.14 Students, through many readings of the text, ac-quire their own unique understanding of its insights, mediated by their own life experiences.15

20 Introducing Daoist cosmology: a better way? 97



There is an important point lurking here. This approach to engaging with the text mir-rors the Daoist notion that ‘truth’ emerges within relationship [5]. There is no one truth, and the text provides one side of a dialogue with us, the readers. Each of us is likely to have different insights and understandings, and these insights are likely to change as we meet the text on different occasions over time. Ames and Hall equally suggest that even if we find, in our reading, confusions and seeming contradictions, we should trust that there is a “kind of unquestioned veracity”16 that reflects the culture of the times in which it was written. In other words, let it seep in and approach it openly and generously, rather than with a critical Western mindset.

With regard to the historical context and culture in which it emerged as a text, it is worth noting that the Dao de Jing came together during the Warring States period (403-221 BCE), “one of the most virulent and chaotic periods in Chinese history”.17 The Dao de Jing was a response to this chaos, to those “darkest of days”.18 It provided an alternative vision, a more benign vision of what the human experience could be like.19 Daoism was not the only game in town, and Confucianism, which has a much more hi-erarchical, top-down feel, was its contemporary.

Two final things to say by way of introduction:

First, I recognise that to dare to write about the Dao de Jing, the fifth most translated book,20 is a tall order. I am not holding myself up as an expert in Chinese philosophy. There are very many suggestions and examples embedded in its pages, and I am not aiming to address all of these. My project is to show how the core Daoist cosmology, which I have hoped to encapsulate, expresses the nature of the complex processual world. Furthermore, I want to share the insights for practice this uncovers. I hope it opens up the exploration for you and serves as a catalyst for further research and con-sideration on your part.

Secondly, Daoism is still practiced in today’s China and elsewhere. Indeed, the World Federation of Taoism was initiated21 at the site of one of the temples of Maoshan, a principal sacred site of Daoism, on September 24, 2023.22 But, as reported by Tim Gar-dam,23 there is a big difference between Daoist ‘religious’ practices and beliefs, and Daoist philosophy. I am not venturing in the religious direction. Neither have I much to say about Chinese medicine nor the martial arts, even though these practices reflect many of the tenets of Daoist philosophy, although I address this a little in [29]. I am concentrating primarily on Daoist philosophy, as revealed in the Dao de Jing and other related texts, specifically The Zhuangzi and The Art of War.

The missionary position



Explaining the nature of language in the Dao de Jing and the dangers of viewing it through

Western modes of thinking inferred by early translators.



I hope the title has got you intrigued. Read on. This piece makes important points con-cerning the nature of language and the pitfalls of seeing things through one’s own

cultural lens.

As I have explained, my way into Daoism is informed in particular by the work of Roger Ames and David Hall. These philosophers have written many books on ancient Chi-nese philosophy, and I find the depth, nuance and scholarship they bring to this task both illuminating and, on occasion, thrilling.24 Their work is well referenced and seeks to position their understanding of the Dao in its historical and social context by dint of working with a variety of Chinese texts from that period. In their 2003 translation of the Dao de Jing, they go to great pains to portray the stanzas with precision and supply copious footnotes and explanations of how they have translated key Chinese characters.

One point they make fiercely and repeatedly is that we must be careful not to read and interpret the underlying Chinese cosmology through a Western lens and poten-tially grossly distort its meaning. They explain how the first Chinese-English dictionar-ies were assembled. This was undertaken in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century by Christian missionaries, whose main purpose was to translate the Bible into Chinese. These missionaries found Chinese characters which seemed to best fit the concepts they wanted to portray, and subsequently “insinuated” these into the dic-tionary itself.25 Hall and Ames explain that the missionaries introduced terms such as Heaven and Truth and Self as translations for Chinese characters which “bear little resemblance to these concepts”.26 Tian, for example, is often translated as Heaven or God. But, if you look up the character tian in a Chinese Chinese dictionary, that mean-ing (heaven) is absent.27

Concepts of Heaven, Truth and Self are overlaid in the classical Western creed by as-sumptions of objectivity, universality, and transcendentalism (as explored in [5]). If such a dictionary is then used to translate the Dao de Jing, it becomes easy to infer that such concepts belong to the Daoist cosmology, whether they do or not.



Beginnings

Let me give an example relating to the idea of beginnings. Chapter 52 of the Dao de Jing

starts with the words, “The world has its fetal beginning that can be considered the mother

of the earth.”28 The Dao de Jing often uses the idea of the mother or the womb or the

bottomless goblet to mean that spontaneity and novelty are without end.

100 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



Ames and Hall explain that the ‘fetal beginning’ is a claim about the continuing present

rather than about some ultimate origin or initial beginning.29 Reading it through a West-

ern lens, it would be easy to conclude that the Dao de Jing is describing a Beginning. Even

more contentious, Chapter 25 states: “There was some process that formed spontaneously

emerging before the heavens and the earth, silent and empty.”30 Ames and Hall explain that

concepts such as heavens and earth, just like the idea of ‘the person’ or ‘the community’,

are not seen as fixed things but as emerging and sustaining patterns. For these patterns

to emerge and sustain, there needs to be a continuous source of novelty and diversity,

a continuous beginning in the continuing present. It is a swinging gateway that allows

novelty to emerge, not a one-off downpour or a gushing spring [5].



Furthermore, Chinese words often correspond to a range of meanings, some of which can seem contradictory. Even when this is accepted, Hall and Ames explain, the ap-proach is not to choose the word that seems best to fit the context, but to understand that the meanings are to be taken as paradoxical, as all relevant at the same time. 31 They say, “many, if not most, of the characters have multiple alternative meanings” and it can appear that “the translator, informed by the context, is [supposed] to select the most appropriate one”.32 Hall and Ames are clear that the translator should not be se-lecting the word that ‘best fits’; a Chinese character does not sometimes mean one thing and sometimes another, but as they explain, it “always means both”.

Shen does not sometimes mean human spirituality and sometimes divinity. It always

means both of these and, moreover, it is our business to try and understand philosoph-

ically how it can mean both.33

This is a very different use of language from that which is common in the West. One further difference to note: there is no distinction between nouns and verbs. Thus, Ames and Hall often translate dao as way-making – a process – rather than way – a noun. Presenting dao as dynamic has a very different significance in that it doesn’t infer ‘the way’ is a ‘thing’.

With all these aspects in mind, Hall and Ames conclude that we need to “maintain two systems of thinking in our minds (the Western and the Daoist) without recipro-cal infection and yet in some way mediate between them”.34 In other words, we have to keep alert to the differences between Western and Daoist modes of thought and guard against reading either of them through the lens of the other. I have to say I find this exhilarating. The assumption that the underlying philosophy of another culture will fit into the schemes and assumptions that are common in a Western culture – a form of cultural reductionism,35 or “an expression of our provincialism”36 – is a hugely important point to acknowledge if we are really to unravel the cosmology underpinning Daoism. Ames and Hall also acknowledge that they cannot claim to have found a literal translation either and must inevitably be affected by both their own “prejudices”37 and lacunae, and by the huge differences in the structure of language between English and Chinese.





22


Yes, we have no cosmos:38 uniqueness not unity



Introducing the fact that Daoism does not embrace universal, overarching mechanisms of

control but views everything as shaped by history and context.



With this dialogue concerning missionaries and paradoxical meanings ringing in my ears, what then, can be said about Daoist cosmology [2]?

The key aspects of a Daoist cosmology, building on Ames and Hall, are:

1. Daoist cosmology does not embrace the notion of an overarching cosmos, a driv-

ing force or ‘permanent reality behind appearances’. It is acosmotic.39

2. Daoist cosmology is processual.

3. Daoist cosmology is relational, contextual and paradoxical.

In this piece, I will start by exploring the statement that Daoist cosmology denies there is an overarching cosmos at all.

The Daoist does not posit the existence of some permanent reality behind appearanc-

es, some unchanging substratum, some essential defining aspects behind the accidents

of change. Rather, there is just the ceaseless and usually cadenced flow of experience.40



Ames and Hall emphasise in bold capital letters that the Daoists do not embrace the existence of an overarching anything. There is no God for them. There is no Divine purpose. There is no Way. There is no coherent Oneness. There are no universal Laws of Nature. There is no Beginning. There are no transcendent ‘Oneness-type’ concepts, nor any appeal to, or recognition of, universality.

The Zhuangzi [assumes] that the process [of Dao] has no initial beginning.41

As they say: “The Daoists’ understanding of cosmos as ‘the ten thousand things’42 means that, in effect, the Daoists have no concept of cosmos at all, in so far as this notion entails a coherent, single-ordered world which is in any sense enclosed or defined”.43

I have discussed the disavowal of a unified cosmos in ‘Unity and uniqueness in’ [5]. In brief, the point is that if there were Unity, a unified cosmos, then everything would be fixed, ordered and pre-determined. There would be no leeway, no individual, indepen-dent agency for anything. It is reminiscent of the discussion that happens in some cir-cles about free will. If the universe is a deterministic machine, then we can say that there is no freedom to determine our future. If we are merely cogs in that machine, we are all, whether we think we are or not, just unfolding along our allotted path, doing what we were programmed to do from the beginning of time. But the Daoists saw uniqueness everywhere. They saw how situations were created out of the unique 102 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



elements that were present and affected by the unique circumstances in attendance. Their whole focus was on uniqueness. They ask: How can we attune to the flow of cir-cumstances of which we are a part? How can we take note of minute changes that may give opportunities for change? How can we become our best selves, so our particular uniqueness plays its part in generating a future that is fruitful for the [local] whole?

This focus on the local and unique – the acosmotic – was where their attention lay, and, according to Ames and Hall, it simply did not occur to Daoists to consider overarching laws or principles. They start with difference; difference together with interconnection can lead to (temporary) order, but the primary ontological quality where everything starts is difference. This is resonant with Darwin – that difference drives evolution, ad-aptation and change; it is also resonant with the complexity perspective in that the sort of order that emerges is self-organising order, shaped by the particularities of con-text [14]. And Gregory Bateson encapsulated the idea in his phrase “a difference which makes a difference”.44

[The Daoist] mode of thinking accepts the priority of change or process over rest and

permanence, presumes no ultimate agency responsible for the general order of things,

and seeks to account for states of affairs by appeal to correlative procedures rather

than by determining agencies or principles.45



I include this snippet from The Zhuangzi which expresses poetically and allegorically this quality of uniqueness:

The wind blowing through myriad different things causes these sounds to die out of their own

accord. Together things each take on their own sounds, but who is behind it all? 46

The snippet is illustrating that there is a relationship between the wind as it shows up in the ‘here and now’ with the particular shape of the things it blows through. Each par-ticular combination of the wind as it blows here, coupled with the particular shape of the thing through which it blows, creates a sound unique for each thing at each mo-ment. And there is nothing and no one behind these sounds.

This acosmotic world has the advantage over its cosmotic rival in that it is brimming with possibility and novelty. Ames and Hall say: “The insistent particularity possessed by each item … expresses itself in processes of self-creative events.”47 This means that a degree of chaos with lots of ‘difference’ going on is a necessary source of creativity and change. In the Anglo-European tradition, chaos is to be overcome, as Plato insisted [5]. In Daoism, ‘difference’, the chaotic element, far from inhibiting order, if left alone to contribute spontaneity, allows for creative transformation and re-ordering.48 Differ-ence is precious, it is the source of potential. Darwin would agree [7] [16].

Everything flows



Exploring the processual, emergent nature of the Dao

Dao is the process of the world itself49



Dao is the central foundation of Daoism.50 It is an ever-emerging way or ways, but not The Way. It is neither the Way of God nor the Way of Nature, in the sense that something pre-exists that we have to try and follow or get in tune with. There is no “single pattern or telos that could be said to characterise its processes”.51 Dao is not a whole, but many such wholes.52 The way is “constituted by a myriad of unique particu-lars”,53 co-created by all that is there.

Moreover, the Dao signifies both the way and way-making; it “entails both the pro-cess [of way-making] and the created product [the way]”.54 And the way is never fin-ished, never becomes ‘the right way’ or ‘this way’. It is always “under construction”.55 Prigogine used a similar phrase:

The future is under perpetual construction.56



In the following, I want to deconstruct various aspects of way-making that Daoism em-braces. This is not a straightforward piece; it introduces several metaphysically chal-lenging concepts. I find it fascinating stuff, but certainly didn’t take on all these ideas at first reading (or writing)!



1. Everything flows: change is the norm and is irreversible

Only becomings are. Prigogine 57

First is the sense of flow and change as the norm. Things are always becoming. This is a central tenet of all process philosophies, not only Daoism.

For the Daoist, the flow of experience has no beginning and no end.58



Furthermore, in this complex weaving of the process of becoming, there is no going back. The process is path-dependent and irreversible, shaped by “a seamless combina-tion of natural and human forces”.59



104 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



2. The dance between what is established and what is

appearing [14]

Refined notes and raw sounds harmonise with each other.60

Next, there is this sense of co-evolution between the flow that is already established, and the events and happenings, choices, actions and inactions that are now happening. These ‘now happenings’ can shape and impact that which is already flowing.

The phrase “the path is made through walking”,61 aims to encapsulate this. I share the whole quote by Machado in the Introduction. To mix metaphors, we step into the flow-ing river, and it already has a great force within it.62 And yet this tree or this rainstorm or this boulder may change its course. The mountains shape the river, and the river shapes the mountains. Everything that is there, seemingly insignificant or not, com-bines to create the future. The path shapes us, and we – and everything else – shape the path. There is not just One Path, but a myriad of paths, like tributaries and feeder springs – they may come together or split apart.

The way is both made and followed.63

As a result of this co-evolutionary process, there is always a dance between the rel-atively stable context and the particularity of happenings here and now. As Ames and Hall say, “A process worldview is one of radical contextuality, where the particular and its context are at once continuous and distinct.”64 This is an intrinsic paradox that the Dao de Jing embraces. Things are “in some degree coherent and determinate” and “in some degree novel and unpredictable”.65

In this evolving order, there is at once a familiar rhythm to life and the newness of each

moment.66



3. Eating your own tail – the mutual entailing of opposites and

the swinging gateway

It is upon misfortune that good fortune leans,

It is within good fortune itself that misfortune crouches in ambush,

And where does it all end?67

Ames and Hall continue: Things are always giving way to other things. Whatever is manifesting, there is always some inkling of its opposite. Death is present from the moment of birth. The masculine element (yang) is embedded in the feminine (yin) and vice versa. However permanent things seem, they already contain the seeds of their demise. Things rise and fall, engage and disengage, live and die. Nothing is ever entirely whole nor entirely distinct and discrete.68 This stands in contrast to the Western myth of progress. It brings into mind the place of collapse, death, decline and life cycles, and their necessity within the stream of life.

23 Everything flows 105



Ames and Hall describe the way forms emerge and are sustained by the weaving to-gether of those ‘ingredients’ that constitute them. They note there are times of rela-tive stasis and times of change.

When this interweaving results in relatively stable ‘wholes’, their qualities are more open to definition and description and are relatively “determinate”.69

Equally, there are times of indeterminacy, when there is “spontaneous emergence of novelty” which can “only be immediately felt”.70 In other words, the early signs of these novel ‘shoots of newness’ are not analysable, and their features are not definable be-cause they have not yet fully come into being; they “resist rationalisation”.71 We have to approach the spotting of new shoots tangentially, it requires a subtle and light touch. This apprehension of the early signs of newness is central to skilful practice for the Daoist, as I will discuss later in this section [27] and is also discussed in Section V on Experiential Ways of Knowing [41].

Ames and Hall make the point that the gateway for novelty is not always open. It is episodic or punctuated [17]. When it swings open, then there is the potential for “un-caused and therefore inexplicable novelty” to arise. When that process is less potent, when the gateway is swinging closed, things may stabilise and persist for a while.

Within the rhythms of life, the swinging gateway opens, and novelty emerges sponta-

neously to revitalise the world … whatever is most enduring is ultimately overtaken in

the ceaseless transformation of things.72



4. Getting it together – ‘consummate integrity’

Able travellers leave no ruts or tracks along the way.73

There are two different but related aspects to integrity. Patterns with a felt sense of harmony or ‘rightness’ are deemed to have integrity, and a person is deemed to act with integrity if he or she is able to skilfully attune to the current flow. This is a phe-nomenon well known to jazz bands who seek to find an integrity of style, a just right-ness in their jamming [19]. Equally, how a player joins the current play requires skilful attunement to what is already in play. This process is also familiar to visual artists [39]. To give an example: In working with artists to develop illustrations for this book, I have been really struck by the fact that there is a point in the composition when it feels the design has arrived – and any additions beyond that can actually take away from that sense of composition. Equally, there are times when a new white blob in the picture just sets it off and makes all the difference!

Another example of attunement in action: Imagine you join a group that has been meeting regularly for some time. Can you attune yourself to the group’s norms – is there an established way of doing things, a slowness or crispness? Are there power relations or hierarchies that may not be overt? How are decisions made? If you can feel into and respond to these often-subtle signals, you may be skilful in deciding how or 106 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



when to make a suggestion, whether or not to rise above the parapet. If judged well, this can engender a feeling of appropriateness and is more likely to be effective than just ‘barging in’ [42].

Integrity is something becoming whole in its co-creative relationships with other

things.74



Ames and Hall say that “integrity is consummate relatedness”.75 I like this. It evokes the sense for me that coming together is more than connection or interconnection; the word consummate captures, for me, that ‘poetic’ sense of wholeness that can emerge and gives something meaning or feels meaningful. It is elegant, poised, and has a sense of exquisite rightness.



5. There are no things: things are porous, processual events

Way-making blunts the sharp edges and untangles the knots; it softens the glare and brings

things together on the same track.76

Ames and Hall position Daoism very much as a process philosophy [35]. In similar vein to the discussion on process complexity [10], they say that ‘things’ are not really things at all, but “are in fact processual events” [6].77 Some constitutive interacting elements may knit together for a while, leading to a fairly stable pattern, but nevertheless, these patterns are always changing and shifting into something else. The word ‘event’ might create a sense of a short-lived process; ‘pattern’ might sound more stable; and a ‘thing’ like a rock or a mountain may evoke the idea of something even more long-lasting. But, as is common with a process view, there is no ontological distinction between events, patterns and things. It all depends on your point of view, and on the spatial and tempo-ral scales that pertain to your domain – be you an ant, a galaxy or a tree.

Ames and Hall take the argument further: “These processual events are porous, flow-ing into each other.”78 This is to recognise that these things/patterns/events are intrin-sically related to those other things/patterns/events that provide them context. I use a description in ‘Introducing process complexity’ [9] of the way ripples on a pond merge and flow into each other, and this is very much the image that Ames and Hall are allud-ing to. Ripples exist, but they are not ‘things’ and are constituted by their interactions and by the nature of the context.

This is quite a leap for the Western mind and cannot just be accepted easily. If I con-sider myself as an individual, then in one sense, given all my cells are replaced over ten years, it is hard to argue with the idea that I am in process. I am also in the process of ageing, and I also change from day to day depending on what I am doing and who I am with. The form I hold shifts, sometimes slowly and sometimes rapidly. It sometimes

23 Everything flows 107



shifts backwards and forwards depending on the situation [19]. The same applies to stars and galaxies and rocks, which, equally, shift, age and morph into other forms. The emphasis made here is a reminder that those things we call ‘things’ are, in general, constituted by the relationships between the elements of which they are made and by their relationships with the wider context. It is a very different view from the Western tradition, which places emphasis on being rather than becoming, and on the primacy of the individual. The focus on becoming is a central tenet of this book, and one to which I return many times.



6. Time and space do not exist separate from events but are

constituted by them



There is one final point to make in this exploration of the Dao as processual, that harks back to the discussion on the absence of a unified idea of cosmos and is also a point made by quantum gravity expert, Carlo Rovelli [6]. Daoists see time and indeed space as constructed by events. They do not think of Absolute Space or Absolute Time. They say:

The Chinese tradition does not have the separation between time and entities that

would allow for either time without entities or entities without time – there is no pos-

sibility either for an empty temporal corridor or an eternal anything (in the sense of

being timeless).79



In other words, things are neither eternally always there (as Newton imagined [5]), nor is there a ticking clock in the universe counting time from the beginning [3], which implies that the universe can then be populated by events (in time’s empty corridor). In similar vein, space is not a pre-existent empty box in which things can happen [6]. Space only has meaning in respect to the relation between ‘things’. Prigogine, intrigued by the nature of time, would have applauded this next statement:

It is the pervasive and collective capacity of the events of the world to transform con-

tinuously that is the actual meaning of time.80



This idea of no absolute time or space is tricky stuff, to say the least. I have returned to these sentences describing the Daoist view of time and space very many times. Discus-sions on quantum physics and quantum gravity [6] [73] describe time and space in ex-actly the same way. But without doubt, this is a mindbender, which needs to percolate. It cannot, I find, be fully absorbed by the analytical mind alone.



108 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



To summarise …



This piece has gone into some depth on the essence of the processual view embedded in Daoism. This is a ‘strong’ processual worldview [43], a view that goes beneath the idea of things, and takes change and ‘always becoming’ as the normal state of affairs. There is the idea of the end being present in the beginning, and the consideration of when we know a pattern is a pattern – the concept of ‘consummate integrity’. The final two sub-sections of this piece morph into the same territory as quantum physics and deconstruct our understandings of time and space. The idea that the Daoists discov-ered the same territory as the quantum physicists, just through observation and expe-rience, seems almost fantastical!





24


We are all in the soup



Daoist cosmology is relational.



There is no view from nowhere, no external perspective, no separate vantage point; we

are all in the soup.81



I am constantly amazed when I read the interpretations of Daoist cosmology, how closely it resembles the tenets of that most modern of sciences, quantum physics.

Physicists Carlo Rovelli, Chris Clarke and others have been pointing out the implica-tions of quantum physics for our ideas about ‘reality’ [73]. Things only really manifest in relationships, and the objective existence of the ‘things themselves’ is contentious. This makes reality paradoxical, as it depends on what is relating to what. Daoism, in similar vein, embraces a non-dualist view; we cannot think of an observer as being sep-arate from what is observed. The viewer is always embedded within it, ‘in the soup’.

Subjects are always reflexively implicated in the way in which they organise the world.82



This same concept underpins the way the Daoists conceive of the person. The word xin, for example, a concept that turns up regularly in the Dao de Jing, is usually translated as ‘heart-mind’. Thinking and feeling are not separated. The idea that we would know something or explain something through ‘just thinking’83 is an alien concept. Recent work in neurology and psychology reaches the same conclusion, as discussed in Sec-tion VI, On Becoming Ourselves.

Ames and Hall also make the point that the Chinese do not think about the self as primarily an inner process and do not distinguish between inner and outer worlds. As they say, “the Daoist self is a function of its relations with its world”.84 A further consequence of this is that “saying, even thinking something about the world is doing something to the world”.85 Prigogine makes a similar point, arguing that the ‘action’ of anticipating the future makes a contribution to now and can impact our choices in the present86 [15].

Furthermore, the Dao de Jing does not differentiate between the human individual and nature. Daoism avoids anthropocentrism. Hall and Ames include the following analogy from The Zhangzi:

If people sleep in damp places, they ache at the waist, and end up half paralysed. But what of

the mud loach? 87





25


Making this life significant



Lessons from the Dao de Jing on how to cultivate your personhood in order to play your role

for the community.

Display a genuineness like raw silk and embrace a simplicity like unworked wood.88



Ames and Hall state that the defining teaching of the Dao de Jing is how to “make this life significant”. We do this by “getting the most out of what each of us is”. 89

A person is … a dynamic pattern of personal, social, and natural relationships.90

The deepening of those relationships that in sum constitute us as a person is a pro-

foundly co-creative process of ‘doing and undoing’, of shaping and being shaped.91



What does this mean, and how do we do it? The Dao de Jing admonishes us to pay at-tention to self-cultivation and self-creation, but this self-cultivation is always seen as a contribution to the strengthening of the community.92 Given each of us has some agen-cy both to cultivate ourselves and to make choices, then to make our lives significant, we have to strive to become our personal ‘best selves’. This enables us to play a part in contributing to the lives of others, engaging with the wider community of nature, and co-creating a harmonious and equitable future. As Ames and Hall say, we each have the potential to become effective and influential in transforming the worlds in which we live.93

Cultivate it in your person, and the character you develop will be enduring.

Cultivate it in the world and its character will be all-pervading.94

Those who are committed to way-making in what they do are on their way.

Way-making is enhanced by those who express character, just as it is diminished by those

who have lost it.95

Endeavouring to become our best selves does not suggest working towards any abso-lute measure or criterion related to ethical codes or established rules of behaviour. It is an invitation for each person to develop his or her particular talents and character, honed by experience and adapted to the current flow of circumstances and needs of the community. Each person needs to recognise the continuity between herself and the other, and then respond in such a way that her own actions promote the interests and well-being both of herself and the other.96

How we make meaning of the world of which we are a part, what we perceive is need-ed, and what we feel we have to offer is always from our own unique perspective. As Ames and Hall explain, “to say something about the world is to say something about 112 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



oneself, one’s disposition, and one’s values”.97 We can thus embrace our own “intrinsic excellence and integrity”.98 We have to work at becoming human.99 Chan Buddhism is strongly associated with Daoism and the Chan meditator is urged to see meditation not merely as focused on calming the mind, but as a practice aimed at self-refinement in the context of what is needed by our community [29].

The practices of Chan are intentional. It is a path going somewhere, not a seat under an

apple tree where the fruit can be savoured. Sheng-yen100



Awareness is essential: preparation is crucial, and practice is indispensable.101



How do we judge what to do? The Dao de Jing does not provide absolute guidance. In-stead, it offers “a vocabulary of images that enable us to think through and articulate an appropriate response to the changing conditions of our lives”.102 Its approach is to nudge, provoke, and catalyse reflection and inquiry – but never to tell.





26


Trust natural harmony



The Daoist is view that leaders need to trust that people will find their own way and that it

is rarely helpful to ‘lead from the front’.

The world is a sacred vessel and is not something that can be ruled. Those who rule it ruin it,

those who control it lose it.103



One of the leadership themes explored within the Dao de Jing is that you should not ever tell people what to do or make them do it, even if you feel your wisdom and maturity means that you see things clearly. The view is that this never works in the end, and “sagacious rulers” need to “trust that the world can be relied on to or-der itself” and “will flourish if left to its own impulses”.104 Indeed, “enforcing order pro-duces disorder”.105 Even if coercion or enforcement is temporarily effective, it can, in the long-term and from a wider perspective, become a source of destabilisation and impoverishment. 106

Cut off cleverness and get rid of personal profit and there will be no more brigands and

thieves.107

Bottom-up, unmediated morality is particularistic and alive; an ethic imposed is at best

an ossified remnant of what was once real morality.108



Part of the reasoning centres on the recognition of our diversity. Because everyone is different, trying to make people accord with one view or one way of behaving strangles that diversity and pushes situations to an extreme, upsetting the rhythm of life.109

It is the diversity in social and natural systems that allows them to find a natural balance.

Some move ahead while others follow behind

Some breathe to warm themselves while others breathe to cool themselves down

Some are strong while others are disadvantaged.110

This confronts me. I am clear that the dictatorial parent may crush individuality, create anxiety, and diminish the growth of a sense of self in their children. Parenting, which aims to hold the space for individuality and maturing, requires much more attention and never has the luxury of easy answers, but it can, arguably, lead to wiser, more poised young adults able to become aware of their own natures.

But never to intervene, never to use power? What should I do if someone beats a dog – or worse, a child – in front of me? What about when societies have become so corrupt or imbalanced that people have lost faith and cannot access their natural proclivity (if natural it is) towards fairness and harmony?

114 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



This is part of what draws me to the Dao de Jing, the wrestle for meaning, the questions it raises, the seeking of the particular interpretation that is appropriate to context. Ames and Hall suggest we should think of “life as art”.111





27


To find the cracks, take in the whole



The idea that by taking in the whole perspective we are best able to spot signs of change ‘at

the beginning of the beginning’.

The slightest fissure produces indications that enable an attentive eye to detect it.112



One of the ideas I am particularly fond of in Daoism is the idea of sensing into the beginning of the beginning of a change. Franc¸ois Jullien, in the Treatise of Efficacy, has this to say:

All his skill lies in the earliest possible detection of the slightest tendencies that may

develop. By spotting these almost before they have begun, before they have had time

to emerge and manifest their effects, he will be in a position to foresee where they will

lead.113

It is only way-making that is as efficacious in the beginnings of things as in their completion.114

This ‘detection of the beginning of the beginning’ is what complexity afficionados refer to as spotting ‘new shoots’ – the nascent emerging of something different, the glim-mers of shifts in the status quo. It creates difficulties for our Western mindset. When do you decide that a drought really is a drought, for example? There is a reluctance for an aid agency to move too quickly, when information is anecdotal and relies on local people who have lived through such times before. But if you leave it until the facts are indisputable, people and animals are already dead or dying; it is too late. Do we value judgement, insight, experience and its resultant wisdom or are we so keen to wait for hard indisputable evidence that we miss the moment? Entrepreneurs know about this. First, you patiently scan for new opportunities, then you act quickly and decisively.

At first be like a modest maiden

And the enemy will open his door

Afterwards be as swift as a scurrying rabbit

And the enemy will be too late to resist you.115



How do you spot tiny changes and quirky opportunities that are particular to circum-stances? The Art of War is Daoist in origin, but, unlike the Dao de Jing, is focused on win-ning battles rather than cultivating your nature. However, it gives interesting insights as to how to spot any signs of newness, and notice ‘cracks’ that offer new opportunities.

It suggests that we need to gather as much information as we can and consider “all the details that produce the totality of the present”.116 In that way, we can glean a compre-hensive understanding of the actual circumstances. This “empowers the imagination” 116 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



to register and take advantage of the “full range of inherent possibilities” in the situ-ation.117 So by widening the field of inquiry as much as possible, we are most likely to spot all the options for action. The Dao de Jing agrees.

The Dao de Jing encourages a comprehensive, processual view of experience that

requires a full understanding of the larger picture and the ability to locate and appre-

ciate the particular event within it. This broad view allows one to contextualise partic-

ular events and provides the peripheral vision to stay focused while at the same time

anticipating future turns.118

In other words, it is through giving full attention to the broader picture that the partic-ularity of opportunities can be visible. These may be nascent signs of newness, or they may be already existing gaps or cracks that we spot more clearly through viewing the whole.

Ames says this method is “radically empirical” in that it implicitly assumes that the details and context governing a particular situation are always unique. We have to approach a situation by investigating its particularities; what we did here or there, or what we have learnt on average from analysing similar situations, will not do. There is a need to gather information in a particular situation widely and, at the same time, be alert to any signs of change. Like birdwatching it is through continuously taking in the wide expanse of terrain that the birdwatcher spots the slight movement that signifies that a bird, notable through its actions and form, has come into the scene.

This bird-watching process results from ‘field awareness’ – taking note of the “rela-tional character of the web of events” and the resultant patterns or “symbiotic conti-nuities” that sustain.119 I discuss this further in ‘Strategy in context’ [56].

This focus – on viewing widely and thus spotting opportunities – is what leads to in-sight.120 This is the source of wisdom for the Daoist – a wisdom emerging from insights in the present moment pertinent to the unique circumstances at play.121 This is not Wisdom that can be transferred from situation to situation, but wisdom that comes from immersion in the particular.

I find this fascinating, perhaps because it accords with the approach I outline in [56] in relation to strategy development. In that piece, I share a method to explore the complex context as widely as possible, thus allowing opportunities, threats and new emerging features to become more visible. Had I internalised this aspect of the Daoist philosophy before I developed my own approach, I wonder? Not consciously, but may-be I had. This idea of homing in on potentially useful actions through staying with the wider field is also an example of what has been called ‘finding the simplicity the other side of complexity’ as discussed in [55].





28


Mutual entailing: me for you, and you for me122



The impossibility of separating things out and the idea that ‘for each of us to flourish, we all

have to flourish’.



The vocabulary of Ames and Hall challenges me to worry away at it and dig for meaning. So … we arrive at mutual entailing! I introduced this topic in ‘Everything flows’ [23] and here I see what else it might err entail.

The point is, in this mutual entailing, there is an impossibility to separate me from you or me from the context. What I do necessarily affects you, and what you do neces-sarily affects me. Thus, if I have better information than you, or have better analysed that information, or been more insightful and strategic in what I have gleaned from the information, then I can make a move. This inevitably will change the ground and change your options. As I understand it, this is a central aspect of the Chinese martial arts. Even doing nothing has an impact. With respect to the power of doing nothing, I think of the ‘broken record technique’.123 If I keep calm and keep merely repeating my position despite anything you may say, then in the end, you may find it impossible to maintain your energy of resistance, and your opposition may lose energy and collapse.

There is another important aspect to the implications of mutual entailing, and that is to do with moving quickly, as in the martial arts. If you spot an advantage, it is of-ten through moving quickly that you can outmanoeuvre the other. Think of those quick-witted ones in business meetings who seize an opportunity to make a point and sway the group, whilst you, still floundering for words, miss the moment.

Note that the Daoist is talking about apprehension and then action – about knowing through using the senses and then moving into action. He stays alert to the myriad of signals emanating from the ‘other’ and the context. He then seeks to see patterns in that information and also spot signs of emerging change from which he can profit. This is predominantly a right-brained, intuitive process informed by information; it is not predominantly a left-brained analytical process [45].

In contrast, in traditional approaches to strategy development, it can seem that we are taught to analyse the situation and decide on the best action as if nothing were changing, as if no one else were acting. In reality, our strategic actions, in the process of enacting them, will limit or open up possibilities for other actors, who will both respond to us and make their own play. Strategy implementation is more like playing rugby than plotting a campaign to cross the Andes [56]. Strategy needs to be, at least in part, strat-egy in action, strategy reacting to the actual unfolding of situations as we progress.

Self and enemy are coterminous and mutually entailing … we are able to redefine our-

selves and the enemy by coordinating shared relations to precipitate an advantage.124





29


It’s experience that counts



Daoism is a naturalistic metaphysics, developed experientially.



I want to end this section by really underlining that Daoism is a philosophy that emerged through engaging with experience, through paying attention to what is hap-

pening around and within. This is an example of what John Dewey called a natural-istic metaphysics, a metaphysics that does not come from the “study of an ultimate, abstract or cognitive reality, but a reality that is forever immediate and emergent”125 [2] [34]. This is ‘radical empiricism’.126

In order to be in a position to attune to the world around you and to your own felt expe-rience, practices such as Tai Chi and Qigong were developed to “root people in natural process”.127 The focus is on “the immediate experience of things”128 not on explanations emerging from theories.

Chan Buddhism was strongly influenced by Daoism,129 and developed various medi-tation practices to bring the practitioner into quiet awareness in order more fully to experience herself, the nature of her surroundings and her connection with it. Practi-tioner’s insights and instincts, then, are kickstarted and honed by this experiential im-mersion rather than relying primarily, as is valued in the West, on the analytical mind.

[Chan] is empirically based, insights coming not from belief or abstract speculation, but

from close attention to the deep nature of cosmological process and our everyday ex-

perience.130 David Hinton131

[Meditation] is “sitting still in Dao’s company”. Hinton132

John Crook describes the aim of Chan practice as “seeing the nature” of “the flowing aspect of everything co-arising”.133 This co-creation or co-arising implies that we can never be entirely separate from our environment and hence from ‘nature’.

[Chan] is what we might now call, ‘deep ecology,’ meaning it weaves human conscious-

ness into the ‘natural world’ at the most fundamental levels. Hinton134



Hinton further makes the point that this grounding in experience “comports with mod-ern scientific understanding.”135 It is ‘scientific’ when the world is complex, contextual and emergent. Given the thesis, the starting point for this section on Daoism, is that complexity science and Daoism are almost indistinguishable in their philosophical stance, I can only agree.

120 Section III Daoist Cosmology: a Better Way?



Concluding …



I hope this section has proven interesting and illuminating. I never seem to get tired of returning to these ideas; they inspire me. They inspire me in part because of the shared cosmology with complexity. But, further than that, I find the Dao de Jing inspiring be-cause it exhorts me to ‘make this life significant’ and to ‘cultivate’ myself in service of the community.





Section IV




Other Resonant Perspectives





30


Introducing other resonant perspectives



Taking a wider view of complexity and exploring other processual traditions.



There are many approaches to complexity and, equally, many processual bodies of knowledge. In Section II, I introduce Process Complexity. In this section, I take a wider view of complexity theories, and also explore other processual traditions – pro-cess philosophies, Pragmatism and process sociology. The process approach embodied within Daoism is considered in Section III.

The first piece, ‘The raw and the cooked’ [31] differentiates, to use the categories in-troduced by Edgar Morin, between ‘restricted’ and ‘general’ complexity.1 In a nutshell, the focus of restricted complexity is to find useful ways to represent, to map the com-plexity of the ‘real world’. General complexity is more concerned with the nature of the ‘territory’, rather than the map. Process complexity [10] sits within general complexity, and the work of Ralph Stacey and Paul Cilliers – two foundational complexity thinkers – increasingly moved there too. In ‘Different flavours of complexity’ [32], I describe their work and also comment on approaches that emerged from the biological rather than the physical sciences.

Following this, I explore the territory of process sociology [33] and take an overview of process philosophy – from Heraclitus to Whitehead and process theology [35]. I discuss Pragmatism [34], focusing in particular on the work of Mary Parker Follett. I am engaged by the way she describes and considers complex situations. I reflect, in all these pieces, on similarities and differences with process complexity.

I find it reassuring that this processual view of the ‘nature of the things’ has emerged in so many fields. Daoists and Buddhists, early modern process philosophers, Pragma-tists, process sociologists and biologists – along with other complexity thinkers coming from different starting points – describe the world in very similar ways. It is significant that these are fields of knowledge in which people are primarily paying attention to ex-perience, immersing themselves in the complexity of the world around them. This leads to naturalistic forms of metaphysics, derived empirically, not from abstract conceptual thinking or mathematics.



What I don’t cover in depth



My focus is to reveal the nature of the complex world. This is predominantly an onto-logical venture. My belief is that, out of such grappling with the nature of the world as it is, out of this ‘making sense’, we may change our views as to how to ‘make waves’, live skilfully and make a difference. So, in my explorations of approaches to complexity, I have preferenced those which derive their ontological perspectives from the dirt of experience.

124 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



I pay less attention to approaches that are more epistemological or methodological in their quest, ones that fall more within Morin’s classification of restricted complexity. I have little to say about the field of systems thinking,2 nor do I focus on computational approaches. I don’t cover the contribution of the Santa Fe Institute, other than through the work of W. Brian Arthur, Stuart Kauffman and Brian Goodwin. I don’t tend to use the phrase ‘complex adaptive systems’3 because, as I go on to discuss, I share Stacey’s concern about the reification of ‘systems’, discussed in [31]. I am also concerned about the reification of the notion of ‘adaptation’; it seems to me that sometimes thing adapt to changing circumstances, and often they do not.





31


The raw and the cooked4 of complexity



A comparison of restricted and general complexity; considering the difference between

working with the map and engaging with the territory.



To talk of complexity theory or complexity science is a complex thing in itself. Not everyone is coming from the same place, and this can be confusing to navigate. 5 To aid this navigation, I build on the categorisation introduced by Edgar Morin in Re-stricted Complexity, General Complexity.6 Morin makes a distinction between a framing of complexity that sits within the ontology of classical science, which he calls ‘restricted complexity’; he contrasts this with the raw ‘general complexity’ of the ‘real world’. Gen-eral complexity is more paradoxical, more integrating, more challenging, ambiguous and uncertain – but also ripe with potential. The basis of Ilya Prigogine’s ideas, intro-duced in ‘Messiness is next to openness’ [8], sits within general complexity, and general complexity forms the main orientation of this book. However, in this piece, I want to explore the difference between these two ‘schools’.

Restricted complexity emanates from the world of models, maps and mathematics. The aim is to find ways to represent the complexity of the real world. The focus is on finding a good map. General complexity, by contrast, starts further back into the primordial mud, and champions the attainment of knowledge through wandering the ‘territory’. Alfred Korzybski’s phrase, “the map is not the territory” seems pertinent here!7

General complexity is complexity that is beyond (or before) mathematics – complexity that cannot entirely be captured by models, flowcharts or causal loop diagrams. In the main, the physics and biology of open systems sit within the ‘general’, and present a picture that is more messy, more concerned with engaging with the rich nature of the terrain than a representation of that terrain. The work of process sociologists tends to be served up ‘in the raw’, and complexity thinkers Ralph Stacey and Paul Cilliers moved increasingly in that direction. General complexity often starts with experiment and observation – of forests, cells, swirls in chemical systems, galaxies, social groups or so-cieties – rather than with conceptual abstractions. Both approaches to complexity are designed to help us determine how to act and live in the complex world; both see a role for models and maps, but they are situated within distinct ontologies.



Restricted complexity



Morin reminds us that “the mission of [classical] science is to search for … the hidden order that is the authentic reality of the universe.”8 Approaches that fit the label of restricted complexity are focused, he says, on revealing such hidden order. The mod-els and mathematics required to achieve this are far from simple, but there is an 126 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



underlying assumption that there is something objective and definite lurking beneath. The inference is that there is order to be uncovered, and a presumption of stability rather than instability. These assumptions are brought into question within general complexity.

Complex systems, from this restricted perspective, are comprised of “a very large num-ber of interactions and feedback, inside of which processes [are] difficult to predict and control”.9 Nevertheless, as Morin says “one still remains within the [framework] of classical science”.10 In other words, the implication is that, with clever mathematics and computational techniques we can represent and understand ‘real-life’ pretty well. Kurt Richardson and Paul Cilliers11 call this hard complexity, and David Byrne describes it as “social physics”, which, he says, “remains in important respects merely reductionist”.12



Cybernetics

One of the early developments that led into complexity thinking was cybernetics, as-

sociated with Norbert Wiener.13 The emphasis in cybernetics is on how to control and

stabilise ‘systems’14 using negative feedback loops, which tend to bring forces into bal-

ance. Imagine you are sailing a boat; there is wind and current, and you have a rudder,

a sail and your body weight. You are trying to cross an estuary, using the tools under

your control (weight, rudder, sail) to work with the external forces of current, wind, and

tides; you are using feedback in real-time. The number of variables – wind, tide, rudder,

sail – is small, although the feedback processes will subtly change with the conditions

and will require fine-tuning.15

Cybernetics uses this kind of thinking to explore problems in other spheres. It garnered

interest, for example, in exploring the self-regulation of biological systems.16 Living

systems tend to self-regulate – to balance themselves – or else they die. Focusing on

negative feedback loops is a useful way to conceptualise the processes adopted by liv-

ing organisms. However, cybernetics does not look at the detailed micro-processes, but

conceives of them in aggregate, as nutrient flows or cell densities, for example.



Byrne takes the strong position that “the development of systems of equations, how-ever sophisticated, may well have very little to tell us about the social world”.17 Cilliers takes an equally strong position, arguing that restricted complexity “can only deal with technical issues in an instrumental way”.18

Max French et al. find that many public health studies follow the model of ‘complex adaptive systems’ which, they explain, fits within a restricted complexity approach. They comment:

The methods that predominate in the policy literature to cope with complexity … hold

as their core purpose the attempt to wrestle complexity into a manageable format,

with complexity functioning, as Morin described, as a ‘kind of wagon behind the truth

locomotive’.19



These are challenging statements. Modelling, of course, does have much to offer when exploring complex situations. However, like Morin, my main preoccupation is to ask

31 The raw and the cooked of complexity 127



what exists in the world that is not easily captured by mathematics or modelling, how-ever sophisticated those technique may be.



General complexity



General complexity aims to focus on the real-life situation itself, rather than a simpli-fied representation of it. Prigogine mused about the behaviour of swirls and patterns on the surface of dishes of chemicals in the Belousov-Zhabatinksy experiments [8]. Bi-ologists such as Umberto Maturana and Francisco Varela considered the ways cells and biological systems retain a degree of form or order through wobbling and self-reg-ulating around that.20 Stacey and Cilliers, in their different ways, focused on the so-cial world. There was recognition that, for patterns to emerge, situations need to be open to their wider surroundings, and there must exist a level of diversity and variation amongst the constituents. There is also an irreducible, entwined inter-relationship be-tween the micro and the macro.

The knowledge of the parts is not enough, [but] the knowledge of the whole is not

enough if one ignores the parts. Morin21



Morin raises the issue of the “relation of whole-part mutual implication”, which is to say that we can never entirely tease apart any emerging forms or ‘wholes’ from their constituents. The forms that emerge cannot be reduced to their parts, or straightfor-wardly be built up from their parts. And ‘the whole’ is never entirely ‘whole’. There is a degree of order or form, but it never entirely stabilises, and there is always a degree of disorder. Situations are inherently paradoxical, not entirely definable, and liable to change over time.

Prigogine, Allen and colleagues describe how patterns – forms – stabilise through the interplay of reflexive yet varying relationships; but these very same processes also cause patterns to lose integrity, shift or dissolve. The same process that creates sta-bility also dissolves it. For example, the chemical systems in the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction that started Prigogine on his exploration of open systems, display emergent patterns.22 But these patterns are always subtly changing, and it is impossible to pre-dict where they might emerge and for how long they might sustain.

This paradoxical, elusive dance – between order and disorder, between stability and chaos, between form and formlessness, between uncertainty and certainty – is the stuff of general complexity. There is always an irreconcilable, intrinsic tension that must be embraced. There is no assumption that there is an objective ‘order behind appearances’. Features that are paradoxical, subjective, sometimes emerging and sometimes stabilising cannot be reduced to objective and definable parameters and dimensions, as in classical science. Moreover, this ‘messiness’, a messiness that cannot be captured by analytical means, is both inevitable and a largely positive quality of the world. Indeed, it is the source of novelty, emergence, resilience and change.

128 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



A note on modelling



The focus of this book is to stay with the territory of the complex world and explore what that means for practice and action. I am also intrigued as to how the complexity worldview, at its richest, resonates with other bodies of scholarship including neuro-science, process philosophy and certain political perspectives.

I am therefore not placing attention on maps and modelling; rather, I am exploring as-pects of the complex world that are not easily capturable through these methods. But this is not to dismiss their role. Climate change models, for example, which use highly sophisticated mathematics, are of vital importance. Thomas Schelling, to give another example, modelled segregation in cities.23 His work illustrates how the emergence of patterns of extreme segregation requires only a very slight, not strong, preference to live in areas along with people ‘like you’.

It is also the case that every sort of research methodology necessarily closes off some information, bounds the problem in some way, and ignores certain aspects of the situ-ation. Even language itself is a way of modelling the world, and itself limits to what we pay attention, and how we frame what we see.

Mathematics, models and maps can have great value in surfacing hidden patterns. But the complex world can have many aspects and features that cannot easily be captured objectively. Models may be very helpful or may be very misleading, as Peter Allen demonstrated in his example, below, of Chesapeake Bay.24



Chesapeake Bay

Allen’s model of Chesapeake Bay was built on actual data as to which species existed

in the bay, their population densities, average sizes and who ate what. But when the

model was used to predict the future, it did not display the resilience found in real-life;

in the model, the species populations collapsed. Why was this? Because, if something

changed – maybe a reduction in a certain type of food – then what happens in real-life

is that the weakest and oldest members of a particular species would perish first, thus

changing the average age and weight of the population. Then maybe that species would

survive less well and create the space for a rival species, able to eat a wider variety of

food types, to gain prominence.

The balance in the ecology was maintained by adaptations at the micro level, thus ren-

dering obsolete the aggregate parameters held in the model. This flexing and shifting

at the micro level is the way patterns are held together, and it can lead to balance. This

micro-shifting is very specific to the particular conditions and chance events that occur

and is thus very hard to capture in a model. If we, in effect, assume that the measured

inter-relationships between the different fish systems and their food systems are set

in stone, and can be represented at the macro level, then we are letting the actuality as

to how resilience or change happen be rendered invisible, and slip through our fingers.

31 The raw and the cooked of complexity 129



Where models are used to for the purpose of prediction, it may be possible to compare their outcomes with ‘real-life’ and then consider in what ways the model is deficient, and what has been omitted that seems to be relevant. But there will always be a gap.

I list below some of the limitations of mathematical models.

Boundaries: Models generally need defined boundaries. But what if the absence or permeability of boundaries – letting in new aspects, or providing resources or energy – is significant in real-world situations? Models tend to be better suited to exploring closed problems rather than open processual situations.

Paradox: Models cannot easily handle paradox, an important aspect of the complex world.

Human complexity: Humans in interaction are supremely difficult to model. Models of the social world struggle to do much more than assume people can be represented as ‘units’ connected by forces or following rules. A degree of learning may be incorpo-rated into some of these units, but the sheer complexity of unique humans, and their complex histories as they engage in interactions with other unique humans, cannot ad-equately be captured. This may not be of concern when developing simple models look-ing at specific issues, such as queueing or crowd behaviour. But in general, the complex interplay of inner and outer worlds, of history and context, of reason and emotion is beyond the limits of what modelling can achieve. For example, trying to include, in cli-mate change models, how the public might respond to predictive information, or how they are reacting to the experience of a changing climate, is very tricky; it is hard to anticipate how people will respond, and how their responses will impact others.

Helpful in exploring the now: Mathematical modelling and process mapping can help a great deal in uncovering the complexity of ‘now’ and can provide a ‘systems perspec-tive’ that brings to light current systemic patterns. For example, I advocate a particular mapping approach to analysing complex contexts in [56].

Not so good at handling an emerging future: What is arguably much harder to surface through modelling is what the future might look like – when that future, as is the case in most situations with open boundaries involving humans, is not just an extrapolation from the past. There may be something new entering the field, such as changing global conditions or a technological innovation; there may be aspects of the system which, whilst currently inconsequential, gradually gain in importance and can tip the system into a new form. It is hard to model open systems and trace the processual, flowing, changing aspects of situations. Models and maps struggle to illuminate what might emerge, what might invade the system, and what new forms could possibly evolve. To put it another way, if the detail that is left out of the models is the very thing that catalyses the emergence of different futures, then the outcomes of the models must, at the very least, be viewed with caution, and may indeed be very misleading as Allen showed with Chesapeake Bay.

One thing a person cannot do, no matter how rigorous his analysis or heroic his imagi-

nation, is to draw up a list of things that would never occur to him. Schelling25 130 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



Most modellers tend to be well aware of these limitations, but those policy makers who are the recipients of models are often looking for certainty to back up their poli-cies. So, it is tempting for policymakers to underplay the limitations of the models, and to present conclusions as more definitive than they are. Then, if predictions turn out to be inaccurate, the public may start to distrust modelling, or distrust policy makers – or even, as is often said, come to distrust ‘the science’.

One final point to emphasise: In these comments, I am focused on the limitations of us-ing models to explore open situations in the complex social and natural world. I am not refuting the power of mathematical models when designing bridges, or spaceships, or getting to the moon. The problem arises when we hope the social world will mimic the behaviour of complicated, but essentially definable, mechanical situations.



Complexity as metaphor

A man’s reach should exceed his grasp Or what’s a meta for? Gregory Bateson26



I want to turn my attention to the use of complexity concepts as metaphor.27 Mathe-matical models adopt particular types of mathematics and make a variety of simplify-ing assumptions. The models themselves sometimes display certain exciting-sounding characteristics such as strange attractors, the edge of chaos, small things have big ef-fects, equifinality or power laws.28 The point is that many of these features are artefacts of the models, rather than a representation of actualities of the real world.

It is easy to become entranced by these concepts and infer that they encapsulate com-plexity theory. The problem is that some of them are incompatible; they come from different classes of model. For example, some situations are strongly impacted by ini-tial conditions, expressed by ‘the butterfly effect’;29 other situations are stubbornly in-dependent of initial conditions and end up at the same end point whatever, seemingly, you do. This is equifinality. Concepts can become reified – treated as if they are real things that exist in the real world. I can see that, if these concepts and used metaphor-ically, they can play a useful role in catalysing the imagination. Metaphor can shake us out of mindsets and offer partial perspectives and useful challenges. But some meta-phors are more appropriate than others, some metaphors are misleading and even the most apt remain … metaphors.



And things are never that simple …



Returning to ‘raw’ general complexity and ‘cooked’ restricted complexity, Morin’s point is that, for some people, constructing rule-based models of ‘things’ connecting togeth-er, seems self-evidently a helpful approach to shed light on what is happening. For oth-ers there is a deep wariness about an over-reliance on mathematics and computation.

31 The raw and the cooked of complexity 131



In practice, both have value. And the truth is that, even if we try, we can never work with all the information that is there, so in some sense or another we are always mak-ing choices about what to include and what to ignore, whether computational models are involved or not. I have always been amused by Jean-François Lyotard’s take on this, captured in the following quotation. If we were to try to know everything before we decide anything, it would take us all our time, and the situation, in the meantime, would have been changed by the process of looking!

A complete definition of the initial state of the system would require an expenditure of

energy at least equivalent to that consumed by the system to be defined. … A layman’s

version: An emperor wishes to have a perfectly accurate map of the empire made. The

project leads the country to ruin – the entire population devotes all its energy to car-

tography. Lyotard30

Sometimes we like our complexity raw, and sometimes we know it has to have a degree of cooking for it to be palatable, depending on the context and our aims. We all adopt some form of framing, some form of modelling, if only through the way we talk about something. We all ‘abstract’ to a degree and go beyond merely immersing ourselves in the world’s complexities. For example, Carl Weick discusses how even hunches can be thought of as a type of internalised model.31

Without an ability to abstract and consider the implications of a complex world, we would struggle to make sense, make decisions and take action. But we need to take care to not become blind to our simplifying assumptions and wedded to our preferred methods. We should continue to remain alert to what is missing and what is shifting and keep an eye on the skittishness and ‘wilfulness’ of the territory, and its ability to confound us.

Different flavours of complexity



Discussing the work of Stacey, Cilliers and the approaches to complexity that emerged from

the biological sciences.



There is inevitably a difference in emphasis, or a difference in basic assumptions, that underpin independent fields of scholarship. The understandings of the com-plex world, emerging from the fields of physics, biology and social science, are not iden-tical; each contains different slants and emphasis.



Complex responsive processes and ‘différance’



Some complexity scholars, although they started their journeys into complexity with the science of physics or biology, increasingly took their inspiration from the study of social life.

For example, Ralph Stacey’s first book, The Chaos Frontier,32 built on chaos theory; later he introduced influences from group analysis and process sociology into complexity science, and developed ‘complex responsive processes’.33 He and his colleagues, in-cluding Patricia Shaw34 and Douglas Griffin,35 explored the micro-practice of conver-sations, and showed how complex patterns of relationships, and patterns of meaning and identity, emerge one sentence and one gesture at a time. Stacey and his colleagues “place social interaction at the heart” and explore how this social interaction “creates patterns of relating and then more patterns … patterning and then further patterning of experience”.36 Their work provides an essential contribution to the development of a process complexity ontology and brings to life the way patterns emerge and sustain in organisational life. And, through their focus on the person, they explore how qualities such as intention, memory and power amplify and enrich the patterning process.

Paul Cilliers moved from engineering to philosophy and is renowned for his book Complexity and Postmodernism.37 He, like Stacey, turned his gaze to human behaviour, specifically the reflexivity of micro-variations in interactions between people. He be-came intrigued by différance, having been attracted to the work of Jacques Derrida.38 He paid particular attention to ethics, perhaps not surprising as he was writing in South Africa towards the end of apartheid.39 Cilliers’ ideas have further evolved, in particular through the work of Minka Woermann and Rika Preiser.40

It is not possible to tell a single or exclusive story about something that is really

complex. Cilliers 41



Cilliers made the point that, because we cannot deal with complexity “in all its com-plexity”, we inevitably have to make judgements about how to reduce that complexity 134 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



as we try to understand it. As he says, there is no objective way to do this. There is a sense in which what we choose to focus on, what we emphasise, and what we leave out, are inevitably choices with ethical implications.42

The practices of Stacey and Cilliers differ from each other, but one common factor is their recognition of the importance of difference. As discussed in ‘The essential condi-tions for complexity’ [11], a core ingredient of rich complex situations resides in differ-ence or diversity – the variety and non-conformity that exists in any social grouping or natural ecology. Stacey and Cilliers were both interested in how differences – in a ges-ture, in an opinion – are reflexive, and how they fuel the patterning of the social world. Gregory Bateson remarked that the bridge between reality ‘out there’ and perception ‘in here’ “must always be in the form of difference”.43 Through being open to the nu-ances in what is occurring in the outer world, we may rattle the certainty of our inner world of beliefs.

Our identity as individuals or groups of individuals, is not an essential characteristic,

it is a dynamic property which is constituted relationally. It emerges through the in-

teraction of difference. Difference and asymmetry are necessary for the richness of a

complex system, it is the most important resource of a complex system, not a problem

to be solved. Cilliers and Preiser44



Complexity and the biological sciences



Ludwig Von Bertalanffy was one of the first people to equate systems thinking with the behaviour of biological organisms. In General Systems Theory, he advocated “an organis-mic conception in biology which emphasises consideration of the organism as a whole and sees the main objective of biology as the discovery of the principles of organisa-tion at its various levels”.45 As with any perspective, taking learning from the biological might lead us to make certain assumptions. I want to consider two of these: one is the tendency for self-regulation and the other is the idea of the life cycle.

Self-regulation



Biological organisms try to stay alive. Autopoiesis is one expression of this tendency to self-regulate in order to survive.46 This resonates with the idea of natural law, which, as Thorstein Veblen explains, suggests that it is ‘natural’ for things to find balance.47

When looking to apply these ideas to wider situations, we have to ask whether it is appropriate to assume the success of self-regulation. Clearly those biological systems that survive are ones that found a way towards a dynamic balance with their environ-ments – they extracted their resources, but not to such a degree as to destroy them. But, as I discuss in ‘Patterned’ [14], ecological systems do not always survive, they sometimes collapse. And, to state the obvious, only those biological systems that sur-vive have survived! Many possible biological options, some perfectly viable, do not, and, indeed, extinction is much more common than survival. Estimates suggest that

32 Different flavours of complexity 135



99.99 percent of all species that have ever lived are now extinct.48 Humankind, you might argue, is set on a mission of destruction of habitat through climate change, pol-lution, digging up forests and planting monocultures dependent on artificial fertiliser, and so on. We can’t, evidence would suggest, rely on self-regulation.

So, whilst there is a tendency towards patterning, there is also a warning against the assumption that balance is natural, that patterns will somehow look after themselves, and will necessarily self-regulate and stabilise.

The life cycle



Another idea particular to a biological take on complexity is the life cycle. Again, this is a very potent idea. An animal is born, matures and dies. Death beckons, ageing is a one-way, irreversible process. In [14], I consider the life cycle of a forest.

But when we are thinking about the behaviour of complex situations in general, the path is not so smooth; there can be detours and reversals. Societies, for example, might emerge, conquer territories, become great, get defeated and rise again. To give another example, I remember the popularity of Hush Puppy shoes in the 1970s. But, after decades of success, they faded from view, only to be revived again, in the 1990s, through the interest of a designer who got his models to wear them on the catwalk. They became ‘cool’ again, for a while and sales rocketed.49

My point is that we cannot assume that situations in the social world smoothly follow a life cycle; even the pull towards ‘death’ can be circumvented in the short term as new resources and new opportunities arise. The focus on path dependency requires us to stay with the actual journey and pay attention to what is happening. We must not as-sume there is an inevitable smooth pathway towards an expected end point. The ‘path is made through walking’, but the walk does not follow the beat of a particular drum, nor unfold uniformly towards a destination, even that of inevitable death.



Comparisons with process complexity; and the value of

transdisciplinarity



Complexity thinking that evolved through the study of open systems aims to incor-porate no a priori constraints on outcomes.50 There is no assumed teleological pull towards balance and self-regulation, nor an expected stepwise movement towards death. Indeed, locally, the emergence of order through an influx of energy from ‘out-side’ is what allows the birth and the emergence of new forms and features, in opposi-tion to the general trend ‘downwards’.

The work on open systems pays attention to the external environment and to the past. This focus the environment was, perhaps, less prominent in the early work of complex responsive processes, which, in capturing the nuance of human interaction, had less 136 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



to say about the wider field, including non-human elements such as technology and geography, and factors such as laws, rules and established cultures.51

Human interaction also forms the substance of process sociology [33]. Equally, there are many examples of resonant thinking in the work of neurologists and psychologists, as explored in Section VI. The mutual enrichment between all these differing fields of-fers a fruitful way forwards and each approach adds nuance and merit.

It is, however, important to recognise the ways in which each field imports its own lens-es, and to consider what hidden assumptions may lurk in the shadows. Grappling with the complexities of the social and natural world needs at least a multidisciplinary, if not a transdisciplinary, approach.52

We can only approximate an understanding of complexity by employing a plurality of

descriptions. Transdisciplinary activities are our only option. Cilliers and Preiser53





33


Process sociology



An overview of process sociology and its connection to complexity thinking.



We must not begin by talking about pure ideas – vagabond thoughts that tramp the

public highways without any human habitation – but must begin with ‘people’ and their

conversation. Charles Peirce54



Process sociology is very in tune with a processual view of complexity. This brief ex-position only touches on a vast and rich body of knowledge.

Process sociologists do not necessarily address the similarities between their work and complexity theory (why should they), but they have often taken their inspiration from similar roots. For example, in On Organizational Becoming: Rethinking Organization-al Change, Haridimos Tsoukas and Robert Chia begin with quotes from Henri Bergson, William James and Ilya Prigogine.55

Process sociologists focus primarily on interactions between people. In general, they do not consider interactions with the non-human world, or interactions with collec-tive aspects of the world such as ecologies or markets. Their interest is to understand the dynamics of organisations and other social groups. Many explore the impact of language – of conversation and inner thoughts – and how language forms the basis of ‘making sense’ and deciding on actions.

The coexistence of people, the intertwining of their intentions and plans, the bonds

they place on each other, all these, far from destroying individuality, provide the medi-

um for it to develop. … The social fabric, in this sense forms the substratum from which

and into which the individual constantly spins and weaves his purposes. But this fabric

and its actual course of historical change as a whole, is intended and planned by no one.

Norbert Elias56



Elias wrote The Civilizing Process in 1939 and developed a very similar processual worldview to that which underpins process complexity.57 For example, he described the self-organising social process as the “perpetual movement of relations between people as they enable and constrain each other”.58 Stacey tells us that Elias coined the expression “centrifugal spurt” to describe the concentrating of political power.59 This mirrors the discussion in ‘Who got the power’ [70] as to how dictatorially inclined po-litical leaders can enhance and lock-in such power. Equally, Elias saw power as an ev-eryday matter, an inevitable part of interacting.

For Elias, power is a characteristic of all human relating … to form and stay in a relation-

ship with someone else, one cannot do whatever one wants.60 138 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



Elias goes on to describe the systemic nature of patterning, emphasising how patterns develop qualities that are neither planned nor intended. He says:

This basic issue resulting from many single plans and actions of people can give rise

to changes and patterns that no individual person has planned or created. From this

interdependence of people arises an order sui generis, an order more compelling and

stronger, than the will and reason of the individual people composing it.61



Mowles also notes Elias’ attunement to paradox, defined as “processes of inclusion and exclusion, cooperation and competition, stability and change”.62 Elias did not see process as an abstraction, but as something weaving and interweaving in the here and now, between people. Nor, says Mowles, did he see process as producing social wholes.63 Elias’ view is holistic and systemic, but never complete, never ‘neat and tidy’. This is reminiscent of the description of process complexity as the emerging, stabilising and dissolving of patterns of relationships – dynamic, imperfect, temporal [10].

Elias’ interest was in the dynamics of all types of social groups. There are other schol-ars who are primarily focused on developing a processual view of organisations, for ex-ample Chia and Tsoukas. They explore, amongst many other things, the dance between top-down organisation design and the bottom-up impact of people pragmatically try-ing to ‘get things done’. As they say, “organization is an emergent property of change” [59].64

Then there is the issue of sense-making: People in organisations need to grapple with huge amounts of information in order to decide what to do. Sense-making can be seen as a form of pattern recognition. Varney65 describes it as the emergent “patterning of attention” which “involves isolating and communicating … what is given attention from an endless stream of events, actions and outcomes”.66 This process of sense-making inevitably has a ‘political’ aspect, in that it has great power to shape the future.

Carl Weick is a process-oriented organisational scholar renowned for his work on sense-making. He wrote a thought-provoking paper in which he considers “recon-necting flux and hunches” as a way of understanding change management. He regards hunches as intuitions “drawing an inference from slight evidence”.67 Flux, in contrast, is more concrete and closer to first-hand experience. His point is that if change agents become too enamoured with a ‘misplaced concreteness’68 of what is happening, they restrict their ability to re-imagine things from a new angle. Equally, if they get too caught up with their intuitive flurries of insight, they may lose touch with ‘what is’. We-ick’s advice is to ensure reciprocal movement between the two. He also emphasises that sometimes it is the subtle, seemingly insignificant, events or features that hold the key to the change. This is very resonant with Daoism.

Weick’s approach to sense-making,69 according to Tore Bakken and Tor Hernes, is part of a ‘linguistic turn’ in organisational studies. Sense-making is seen as an issue of lan-guage and communication whereby “situations, organizations and environments are talked into existence”.70

33 Process sociology 139



I am not going to go further into this very engaging topic of process sociology. The ex-citing point for me is to see the extent to which the same concepts and understand-ings that emerge through the route of complexity science – flow, paradox, patterning, change triggered sometimes by small seemingly insignificant events, the dangers of reification or ‘misplaced concreteness’, and so on – equally arise when viewed through the lens of social process. And, within an organisational setting, these social interac-tions both shape and are shaped by the rules, structures, formalities, and indeed the informalities, of institutional settings. It is intriguing to consider the powerful role of language both to change and constrain, and I wonder how the power of language weaves together with the power of budgets, technology, and government policy – not to mention the impact of social myths, cultural norms and other external factors – to shape the future.

Pragmatism



Exploring in particular the work of Mary Parker Follett.



Pragmatism emerged in the late nineteenth century, provoked by Darwin’s signifi-cant impact on philosophical thought. Pragmatism also influenced the develop-

ment of complexity thinking. Darwin’s work showed that the particularity of situations mattered, and how evolution is shaped by the details of any variations impacting the local environment [7]. So, as nothing is certain, a degree of pragmatism in required to assessing situations and decide on action.

I have chosen to focus on the work of John Dewey71 and Mary Parker Follett.72 I have only relatively recently been introduced to Follett, and I like the nuance with which she writes, and the way she brings certain ideas to life.

Pragmatism acquired its name, so it is said, because it sits, pragmatically, between the two opposing traditions of idealism and realism. In a nutshell, idealism says that the world is subjective because we approach everything from the depths of our own indi-vidual minds; everything is an idea, so to speak, even the ‘outer’ world. Realism, by con-trast, is taking the position that there is a ‘real’ world out there.73 Pragmatists accept that our minds colour what we experience, and how we interpret our experience, but nevertheless they believe that what exists is more than a matter of opinion. They view the world as ‘real’, even if impacted through our perceptions and our engagement with it. This position resonates with Daoism (Section III) and with a processual view of com-plexity (Section II); I explore the implications for ‘knowing’ in Section V.

Pragmatists also take the view that theorising for its own sake is not worthwhile and, indeed, should be approached with suspicion. Theories, they argue, ideally emerge out of experience – out of active, involved engagement with the world – rather than through ‘just thinking’ about it. Knowledge and theories that help us to make sense of our experience and inform how best to act, are, through the lens of Pragmatism, useful because they are authentic – authentic in the sense that knowledge has had to be grappled for, scrutinised and challenged sceptically. In other words, Pragmatists advocate gaining understanding and developing useful practice through acting in the world. They distrust any idealised, generic, abstracted perspective, and are wary of knowledge that seems disconnected from living; grappling with life is how knowledge is socially produced.

The leading proponents of Pragmatism were Charles Peirce, William James, John Dew-ey, and George Herbert Mead. Dewey, in particular, emphasised that engaging deeply with what is happening to us can demonstrate the extent to which we are entwined 142 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



with, and a part of, the wider world. Dewey says:

Experience is the way we interact with and are radically related to our social and nat-

ural environment; through the concept of experience, we understand the individual as

continuous with one’s environment.74

Dewey is adopting a relational worldview. In other words, we are constantly affected by our relationships and interactions, to the extent that we cannot really assert defin-itively that ‘I am this’ or ‘you are that’. What we become and how we experience each other are functions of the reciprocal iterative interactions between us. Dewey contin-ues: “Both subject and object become integrated in the active and relational process of experiencing.”75

The self is something which has a development; it is not initially there, at birth, but aris-

es in the process of social experience and activity, that is, develops in the given individ-

ual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole and to other individuals in that

process. Mead76

Follett was a political scientist, and “developed [her philosophy] out of her own en-gagement with community issues”.77 She believed that experience is the starting point for theorising. She said “I am giving my experience; I am not giving philosophy out of a book.” She explained that her ideas arose through watching the ways people were “interacting, unifying and emerging”.78

The following gives a flavour of how she considered the reflexive details of interaction that lead to the emerging self:

I never react to you but to you-plus-me or, to be more accurate, it is I-plus-you reacting

to you-plus-me … that is in the very process of meeting, by the very process of meeting,

we both become something different. It begins even before we meet, in the anticipa-

tion of meeting.79



Follett is emphasising that this iterative reciprocal interweaving changes us; that “the self is always in flux, weaving itself out of its relations”.80 She notices that the process starts even “in the anticipation of the meeting”; the inner world of our ideas meets the outer world that we engage with, and idealism and realism are intertwined. Further-more, she does not separate the knower from the known, or the subject from the ob-ject; she transcends ‘subject-object dualism’, and the ‘knower-known dichotomy’.

Follett explores the wide implications of this emergent, relational, contextually shaped worldview that is so resonant with process complexity.

First, there is a focus on the reciprocal shaping of individuals, organisations and societ-ies. The following quote suggests how reflexive interactions lead to the emergence and stabilising of patterns of relationships and resonates with the way I have described the ‘ingredients for complexity’ in [11]. Follett describes how home, school, parents and pupils all mutually shape and influence each other.

34 Pragmatism 143



Think of the boy going to school. He is not responding to the school merely, but also to

his own response to school … going to school may so stimulate him that he works much

better at home with his mother. … And the school too is affected by [the interaction be-

tween home and school]; through either his or his parents demands … it may improve

its methods. And so the interweaving goes on; the more the school alters the boy, the

more chance there is of the boy altering the school.81

Second, Follett explores the way small events have the potential to impact the wider world. This, as she says, gives a responsibility and an ethical dimension to every act, as considered by Paul Cilliers [32]. She says:

I contribute to society my mite, and then … my contribution by means of all the cross-

currents of life always has so much more than itself to offer … when I fail someone or

some cause, I have not failed just that person or that cause, but the whole world is

thereby crippled.82

Third, she explores the idea that difference, including conflictual difference, opens the way for new norms to emerge. I particularly like the emphasis she places on embracing conflict and how she understands how the positive role for conflict requires not seeing the self as fixed.83 She says:

If the self with its purpose and its will is even for the moment a finished product, then of

course the only way to get a common will is through compromise.84

Conflict is generative, she feels, and new ways forward can emerge as a result. In con-trast, compromise, whilst it may engender a safe outcome, does not take us into new territory, and does not invite novelty.

This strikes me as a very interesting insight. If we are fixed, then the best we can do is to find a compromise – as I cannot change, and neither can you. If we are not fixed but always changing, then we can engage with our own inner conflicts, at the same time as responding to any mutual differences or disagreements between us. In similar vein, political scientist Chantal Mouffe emphasises the value of ‘agonistic dissent’ [70].

Follett explores how embracing diversity allows purpose, will and power to emerge through dialogue and mutual struggle. In relation to power, she says:

Genuine power can only be grown, it will slip from every arbitrary hand that grasps

it; for genuine power is not coercive control, but coactive control. Coercive power is

the curse of the universe; coactive85 power, the enrichment and advancement of every

human soul.86

She warns against the ‘herd dream’, the pull to conform and belong:

We are capable of creating a collective will, and at the same time developing an individ-

ual spontaneity and freedom hardly conceived of yet, lost as we have been in the herd

dream … this is the reality for man: the unifying of differings; [but we must] sweat and

suffer to make a whole.87

144 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



In her consideration of creating a collective will, she is touching on the idea of ‘wholes’ emerging through honest tussles with difference. But she sees these emerging, uni-fying themes of purpose, will and power as locally and contextually created, as local wholes. This rejection of the universal in preference of the local is central to Daoism, complexity and evolutionary thinking, as discussed in [5].

Pragmatism reaches very similar conclusions to the processual tradition in complexity thinking. I find it both exhilarating and reassuring that process complexity is reinforced and underpinned by these earlier thinkers, to whom we can turn for insights into how to live and work in a complex world.

Process philosophies



A brief overview of process philosophies and a comparison with process complexity.



In this piece, I want to position process complexity in relation to the more general cat-egory of process philosophy. I overview the history of process philosophy and point

to some of the differences between the two.

As discussed in ‘A complexity view of process’ [10], a processual ontology contains, in general, three related themes:

• The world is constantly in a process of flow, of becoming. Change is the norm and

stasis a special case, rather than the other way around.

• This flow is irreversible. What has happened shapes what happens next, and there

is no going back.

• ‘Things’ in the world are better thought of as relationally constituted, inter-

penetrating patterns – more like ripples than ‘things’. The world is not built up from

building blocks and cannot be deconstructed into irrefutably existent lumps of stuff.

Process complexity emerged from a scientific perspective, but there is a parallel path to this scientific derivation of a process orientation, and that is via the field of phi-losophy. Crudely, philosophers are allowed more freedom than scientists to conjure with ideas; arguably, scientists are more restricted by evidence and proof. There are, of course, overlaps – with scientists becoming more philosophical, and philosophers looking to science to support their musings. And there has always been a dialogue be-tween the two.

In this piece, I want to explore strands and themes within process philosophy. This is not a comprehensive review but aims to draw together similarities and differences of emphasis between process complexity and this more general category of process philosophy.

The first point to make is that many of the features I describe as aspects of process complexity – flow, change, primacy of patterns, irreversibility – will equally be found in the work of process philosophers. I am not trying to claim intellectual primacy for these ideas; more, my project is to show how science gets you to this point, and how the science of process complexity in particular, offers a certain type of illumination. The science route, for example, can provide insight into how patterns of relationships emerge, interact and dissolve.



146 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



The fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.



I start with the pre-Socratic philosophers, notably Heraclitus. Heraclitus and others were working in the West in the same timeframe as the Daoists, based in the East. I discuss the work of the Daoists in some detail in Section III.

Very little is known about Heraclitus, except that “he spent time in Ephesus, he came of an old aristocratic family, and he was on bad terms with his fellow-citizens”.88 Geoffrey Kirk et al., in The pre-Socratic Philosophers, tell us that “all pre-Socratic thinkers were struck by the dominance of change in the world of our experience”, and that, for Hera-clitus, “it was the complementary idea of the measure [or form] inhering in change, the stability that persists through it … that was of vital importance”.89 Heraclitus observed the incommensurability between stability and change, and he noted the way form in-heres in change and change is present in form. This entirely accords with complexity thinking and Daoism, and may seem familiar by now. He said:

Things taken together are wholes and not wholes, something which is being brought

together and brought apart, which is in tune and out of tune; out of all things there

comes a unity, and out of a unity all things.90



Heraclitus is most quoted for his words on flowing rivers. Plato summed it up nicely: “Heraclitus says that all things are in process and nothing stays still; and likening ex-isting things to the stream of a river, he says that you would not step twice into the same river.”91 This signifies that neither you, nor the water you step in, nor the bank, nor the creatures in the water, nor the wind that causes its ripples, nor the rainstorm upstream, are ever quite the same, from moment to moment, and are never exactly repeated. Everything is in perpetual flux like a river.92

According to Kirk et al., a more accurate translation is:

Upon those that step into the same rivers different and different waters flow – they

scatter and gather, come together and flow away, approach and depart.93



Buddhism, also contemporary with Daoism, similarly contains many aspects that are processual in nature, and indeed Chan Buddhism [29] marries the two. Joanna Macy investigated the ideas embedded in early Buddhist teachings.94 She focused on the notion of ‘dependent co-arising’, which presents causality “not as a function of power inherent in an agent, but as a function of relationship”. This dependent co-arising oc-curs because “of the interaction of multiple factors where cause and effect cannot be categorically isolated or traced unidirectionally”.95 This mutual reflexive process, this multi-directional interweaving, is how processes can feed back on themselves and re-sult in relatively stable, self-organising patterns [14]. As Macy says, it demonstrates there is “novelty as well as order”.96

Buddhists, Daoists and the pre-Socratics have in common that they inform their views experientially, rather than tussle with abstract ideas. Their philosophies emerged

35 Process philosophies 147



during the Axial Age when the hierarchies of the late Bronze Age were breaking down across the world and causing people to think afresh.97

Moving on from the fourth century B.C.E., Adrian Ivakhiv usefully lists many others who, to varying degrees, held a process orientation.98 He includes Baruch Spinoza, Gottfreid Willhelm Leibniz and many of the Romantics – with their opposition to En-lightenment’s rationalism – including Goethe and Friedrich Schiller [40]. I am not going to delve further into this broad church, and I jump now to the late nineteenth century.



Process thinkers post Darwin: Alfred North Whitehead and

process theology



The early modern process philosophers, notably William James, Charles Peirce, John Dewey and, a little later, Henri Bergson, were catalysed by the work of Charles Darwin. Darwin introduced the idea that variation is necessary for newness and emergence [7]. These process philosophers embraced the notions of indeterminism, the importance of context, and the primacy of flow.

Then there was Alfred North Whitehead who, in 1929, wrote Process and Reality.99 Whitehead was a mathematician, and was intrigued by the ideas emerging in relativity and quantum mechanics in the early 1900s. Indeed, he developed his own version of relativity.100 He wanted to formulate an integrative worldview, a ‘theory of everything’. Whitehead scholar Michael Halewood comments:

Whitehead aims for nothing less than the construction of an organic system of the uni-

verse that not only brings quantum and relativity theories into coherence, but gath-

ers up scientific truths, aesthetic feelings, and religious values into an integral vision

of reality.101



Whitehead gave birth to the philosophy of organic realism which “rejects the bifur-cation of nature into mind and matter” through a “reformulation of perception”.102 He says “science has taken on a new aspect that is not purely physical or biological. It be-comes the study of organisms”.103 I note that biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, in Gen-eral Systems Theory, rather grumpily comments that he, von Bertalanffy “advocated an organismic conception of biology in the early 1920s”, i.e. before Whitehead’s work on this topic was published in 1925.104

In Whitehead’s words: “The philosophy of organism is mainly devoted to the task of making clear the notion of ‘being present in another entity’.”105 He is capturing the re-flexive ‘I affect you and you affect me’ or ‘I affect the whole and the whole affects me’ mutual interweaving or ‘mutual entailing’, as the Daoists call it [28], that refutes the separation into ‘things’.

We are not only made of stardust but also of starlight. Peter Sjostedt-Hughes106

Actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent. Whitehead107 148 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



Whitehead made a huge contribution to process thinking. For example, he talks about the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, by which he means that there are no objective, fixed, enduring ‘things’.108 He also recognised that change and stability are both insep-arably present.

There are two principles inherent in the nature of things … the spirit of change and the

spirit of conservation. There can be nothing real without them [both]. Whitehead109



He focused on events, seeing these as the coming together of many diverse factors.110 This is reminiscent of the concept of critical junctures or tipping points in complexity theory – those times and places when many intersecting influences create the poten-tial for novelty, and can lead to ‘radical emergence’ [19]. His views also chime with Rov-elli’s comment that events are no more than very short processes; or, conversely, that processes can be considered as long events [6].

In actuality, there are no static substances, but only events, occasions, processes.

Sjorstedt-Hughes111



Whitehead was also of the view that all entities, seemingly alive or not, have a degree of sentience; he saw this a natural next step, having removed the distinction between mind and matter. He was an early panpsychist thinker.112



Comparison with process complexity



Much of what Whitehead and his contemporaries described resonates with process complexity – flow, an organic perspective, and a focus on processes and events. Pro-cess complexity, if it could engage in the debate, would concur with the rejection of a dualism between the inner and the outer world of mind and matter. In Section V, I ex-plore the implications for ‘ways of knowing’ about a complex world in which we think-ing and sensing humans are not separate observers, but are embedded.

However, there are differences. Process complexity has not moved far into theories of perception and mind, nor indeed into panpsychic perspectives that were of such inter-est to Whitehead, Bergson and others.

Metaphysical speculation



Whitehead, Bergson, and Teilhard de Chardin113 were keen to consider how science and spirituality could be re-integrated; Whitehead and Teilhard de Chardin brought God into the picture. This “metaphysical speculation”, as Richard Tarnas calls it, did not go down well with everyone. It did not “possess a sufficiently demonstrable empirical basis”.114 Tarnas continues:

35 Process philosophies 149



There seemed to be no decisive means for verifying such concepts as Bergson’s cre-

ative élan vital operating in the evolutionary process, Whitehead’s evolving God who

was interdependent with nature and its processes of becoming, or Teilhard’s ‘cosmo-

genesis’ in which human and world evolution would be fulfilled in an ‘Omega Point’ of

unitive Christ-consciousness.115



Tarnas is suggesting that there is a desire to combine teleological considerations with the more grounded, experiential development of a processual view – to consider that we might be nudged by, or pulled towards, something that imbues us with ‘godliness’. Whitehead, for example, although he rejected the traditional Christian idea of God, introduced God as the “original potentiality of novelty”, and “the main guarantor of rationality and logic”.116

Whitehead considers God the ground of order and novelty, offering an ‘initial aim’ or

‘lure’ to each emerging occasion. Catherine Keller117

Process philosophy, some argue, really took off through the development of process theo- logy, initially through the work of David Ray Griffin118 and Charles Hartshorne.119 Keller, in On the Mystery, builds on Whitehead’s ideas, and was also influenced by Ilya Prigogine and Stuart Kauffman. She asks, “what does it mean to do theology as an open sys-tem”,120 and states that “a theology of becoming discerns its divinity in and as a living process”.121

Process signifies the intuition that the universe is not a static being or the product of a

static Being – but an immeasurable becoming. Keller122



What tends to underpin process theology is the instinct that there is ‘something’ that calls us to self-actualise and gives us a “cosmic appetite for becoming, for beauty and intensity of experience”.123 Keller describes a God that is “at once eternal and be-coming”.124 She continues: “Creative Wisdom … does not impose order but calls forth self-organizing complexity.”125 This sentiment is captured, I feel, in the following poem by D. H. Lawrence.



Red Geranium and Godly Mignonette, D. H. Lawrence

Imagine that any mind ever thought a red geranium!

As if the redness of a red geranium could be anything but a sensual experience

and as if a sensual experience could take place before there were any senses.

We know that even God could not imagine the redness of a red geranium

nor the smell of mignonette

when the geraniums were not, nor the mignonette neither …

But imagine, among the mud and the mastodons

God sighing and yearning with tremendous creative yearning, in that

dark green mess,

oh, for some other beauty, some other beauty

that blossomed at last, red geranium, and mignonette.

150 Section IV Other Resonant Perspectives



Process complexity, starting more prosaically with a more experiential inquiry, an ap-proach that fits within naturalistic metaphysics, is not driven by a particular desire or aim to marry science and religion. Quantum mechanics (as discussed in [73]) does, however, open the door to mystery and – to borrow a phrase from David Ray Griffin – opens the door to the “re-enchantment of science”.126 There is certainly a recognition within process complexity that the separation of science and spirituality is ontolog-ically artificial, and I share with Kauffman, the author of Reinventing the Sacred,127 an openness to such re-integration. But the idea, animated in Lawrence’s poem, of God and the impact on us of his yearning, is neither inherent within process complexity, nor intrinsic to it. This is a distinction from those process philosophers who are seeking explicitly to integrate God, or a desired or expected endpoint, or a disposition towards goodness, into their processual philosophy.

Ethics



However, the issues of goodness and ethics, and the importance of values and beliefs does emerge as of key importance in process complexity – but it is not seen as some-thing we are nudged towards by God. Its provenance arises from the idea that ‘the path is made through walking’ [15]. We create the future through our actions, and our ac-tions are shaped, in part, by our values and beliefs. In that way, ‘being good’ or other-wise shapes the future. Paul Cilliers and Francisco Varela emphasise this point. Varela comments that if we are laying down the world – not “mirroring” or responding to the world as if it is a certain thing, then this has “an obvious ethics associated with it”. “The ethic”, he says, “is based on permanently giving up certainty”.128

One can argue that there is an advantage in acting ethically, as it can engender trust and enable groups to function; some contend that it confers an evolutionary advan-tage.129 Arguably, behaviour that values others together with the natural world, is more likely to engender a sustainable and resilient future. ‘Good’ behaviour, though, is positioned as a personal choice, albeit one shaped by culture and history. Goodness lured by God, who predisposes us towards it, or Goodness as an absolute concept, are not inherent in a processual view of complexity.

As Kauffman says:

This emerging view finds a natural scientific place for value and ethics, and places us

as co-creators of the enormous web of emerging complexity. … In this scientific worl-

dview, we can ask: Is it more astonishing that a God created all that exists in six days,

or that the natural processes of the creative universe have yielded galaxies, chemistry,

life, agency, meaning, value, consciousness, culture without a Creator? In my mind and

heart, the overwhelming answer is that the truth as best we know it, that all arose with

no Creator agent all on its wondrous own, is so awesome and stunning that it is God

enough for me and I hope much of humankind. Kauffman130





Section V





On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World





36


Introducing experiential knowing



Why experiential knowing is vital in a complex world, and how to go about it.



This section is concerned with how to approach ‘knowing’ in a complex world. In Section II, Process Complexity, I have describe the complex world as patterned, processual and emergent, and discussed how the particularities of context and histo-ry shape what happens. These are ontological statements that describe the nature of things. This then begs the epistemological question as to what knowing means and how to go about it. How to ‘know about’ the complex world forms the subject of this section.

Any methods need to reflect the nature of this complex world – flowing, changing, pat-terned, systemic, and subject to the emergence of new features that could not have been predicted. If things flow and change, we may want to trace the path of this flow over time. If things are patterned, then it will be necessary to have methods that can identify such patterns and distinguish their systemic features. If change emerges in ways that are imprecise and sometimes subtle, then we need to be able to spot early signs of novelty.

Many of these characteristics are qualitative. What are the edges of a pattern? Is that blip a burgeoning sign of change or a mere fluctuation? What really did happen on the path from then to now? Even when quantitative information is available, it generally won’t be sufficient to capture the whole picture. We are often interested in what lies beneath or out of reach of an objective, perhaps smoothed-out, or statistical view. We are asking what makes this situation significant, what are the features and qualities and events that matter here.

Methods of knowing work best when they echo the characteristics of what they are seeking to know. Using methods that infer that the world is made of ‘things’ working together in certain ways (the machine perspective) will not be effective if this is not so. Indeed, if we take such an approach, we may iron out from the start the very complex-ities we are trying to find.

Traditionally, science has privileged knowing through thinking over knowing through

doing. Peter Reason and Hilary Bradbury1

In this section I focus on experiential ways of knowing. Such an approach reflects the contextual, particular, qualitative, emerging nature of that which we are seeking to ex-plore. This experiential approach to knowing does not lead to certainty, because, apart from any other reason, in a complex world there is not certainty to be had. This experi-ential knowing tends to be incomplete and is often paradoxical, driven by the fact that the complex world by nature tends to be paradoxical and indefinite [18].

154 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



No separation between the knower and the known



One very important point to make is that we cannot really separate ourselves from the situations we are trying to observe. We cannot separate the ‘knower from the known’.2 This is for many reasons:

First, even the very fact of observing or undertaking a diagnosis will have an impact on the observed. For example, asking people questions in an organisation alerts them to the way the wind is blowing, to what is being valued. This will condition both what they say and what they do.

The nature of the attention that we bring to bear on the world, and the values which

we bring to the encounter, change what we find; and in some absolutely non-trivial

sense, change what it is. At the same time, the encounter … changes who we are.

Iain McGilchrist3



Secondly, we inevitably bring our own mindsets, biases and values to what we investi-gate. This will shape what we notice and what we ignore and affect the conclusions we reach. Our reason and emotions, the effect of our past, and the impact of something happening in the present will all work together to shape our perspectives. We need to engage attentively, and, as far as possible, without preconceptions – but we will never entirely be able to ‘see’ our own lacunae!

Finally, our perceptual apparatus – what the human instrument can hear and see and how our brains link to our sensory tools – limits what we are even capable of experi-encing.

A human being experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separate

from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of

prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons

nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our cir-

cle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

Albert Einstein



What sort of things are we looking for in exploring

a complex world?



The complexity ontology emphasises the systemic, patterned, path-dependent, par-ticular and emergent nature of things – so our methods of knowing need to be able to engage with such features.

Exploring the systemic, the interwoven: We need to explore things systemically, in their interwoven state. We need a systemic practice and an ability to scan both wide and deep.

36 Introducing experiential knowing 155



Pattern-spotting: We require ways to engage with imprecise patterns – of relationally held, dynamically-stable norms. What does it take to sense into and attune to features that are relatively stable, but not fixed or objectively existent?

Instead of trying to analyse complex phenomena in terms of single or essential princi-

ples, [complexity] approaches acknowledge it is not possible to tell a single or exclusive

story about something that is really complex. The acknowledgement of complexity,

however, certainly does not lead to the conclusion that anything goes. Paul Cilliers4

Recognising patterns … cannot be put into a definite procedure. Richard Feynman5

Emerging signs of change: As well as tuning into patterns, there is the question of how we explore the way these patterns emerge, intersect and dissolve. As part of this, how can we notice any early signs of the dissolving of such patterns, and get a sense of what is contributing to this dissolution? And how can we spot its opposite, when the glim-merings of new features are starting to show themselves? Can we find ways to pay attention to the minutiae of happenings?

Tracing the path that has been followed: As things tend to be in a process of becoming, to attune to this, we will need to pay attention to the ‘steps on the path’ as the future emerges. What methods allow for tracking this dynamic over time, and can also help us to notice the sometimes-tiny steps and happenings that shaped this journey as it unfolds?



Critical subjectivity and multiple perspectives



In these explorations, we are inevitably dealing with subjective perspectives on what we perceive in the world [37]. And we are also dealing with concepts – such as that of a pattern or whole, or of a path, or an emerging sign of newness – when such concepts or notions are not themselves easy to pin down, and do not lead to unambiguous defi-nitions. For example, what, really, is a pattern and how do we know if this is a pattern?

To make sense of this ambiguity, it is often advisable to work with multiple perspec-tives and to work in a way that is ‘critically subjective’.6 In other words, this complex world is not approached with the view that what is there is just relative to each person’s opinion. There is no assumption that any opinion goes, or that things are just social constructions.7

In a foundational view, there is a stable world out there and we just need to find facts

about it. Anti-foundationalism is a relativist position claiming that there are many

worlds equally valid. Post-foundationalism suggests we should find a good enough un-

derstanding of the world for now to take the next step. Chris Mowles8



The advice is to work critically and painstakingly with many diverse views, and with both qualitative and quantitative information; the aim is to ‘home in’ on a sense of what is there, and what is salient. To work critically means to legitimate questions such as: ‘Is 156 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



there any information which points to its opposite’, ‘how is that view biased by previous experience or beliefs’, ‘are there any counter views’ and ‘what is missing’.

We are not looking for overlap or consensus … but for the emergence of new insights.9

Working critically requires more than weighing up views or contributing new informa-tion; it is a transformational process in itself that can bring clarity and often leads to fresh perspectives. A lovely example of teachers working in this way through discuss-ing fictional scenes taking place in the classroom, is included in ‘Artful art’ [39].



Knowing is not generally distinct from transforming



In practice, exploring complex situations is in itself a change process, one that is like-ly to impact both the explorer and the explored. In the process of gaining knowledge, we change our beliefs, our behaviours, and our relationships. Through simply, quietly, wholeheartedly being there, we absorb a deeper, more embodied form of knowledge; we learn afresh and re-conceptualise. And, through seeking to know, we inevitably im-pact the very situations that we are exploring.

So, whilst this section focuses on how to explore the complex world more than other sections do, seeking knowledge is not a practice that can be entirely separated from decision-making or action. These are not distinct steps or processes – know, decide, act. For this reason, methods to gain knowledge are not just considered in this section but are scattered throughout the book.



What this section includes and when to go elsewhere?



In the next piece, ‘On the subjective’, I take a look at what is meant when talking about subjectivity.

In ‘The sounds of silence’, I explore how mindfulness and solitude can engage our deeper senses and change what we experience and what we come to know.

‘Artful art’ explores the role of art and poetry as ways to know, subjectively and holis-tically.

‘Wholesome fare’ focuses on holistic ways of engaging with patterns.

In ‘From morning twilight comes the dawn’, I consider ways to spot the ‘glimmerings of new beginnings’.

Finally, in ‘Staying with the trouble’, I explore how to ‘stay with the path’ and how to notice what emerges on the way.

In this section, I include personal examples from my own experiments in knowing, in the hope that this will brings alive some of the subtleties of following the detail as things

36 Introducing experiential knowing 157



unfold, finding ways to apprehend patterns and wholes, and spotting newly emerging shifts and changes.

In addition to the pieces in this section, some of the pieces in Section VII, Perspectives on Organisational Practice, also include approaches to ways of knowing. ‘Simplicity the other side of complexity’ [55] describes the importance of not overly constraining the information to be considered and suggests boundaries are kept wide so that any ‘simplicity’ becomes apparent. ‘Strategy in context’ [56] explores how those focused on strategy development can scan the context systemically, get to grips with current patterns in the market or environment more generally, and also be skilled at spotting opportunities or nascent change. ‘Paradox, polarities and the middle ground’ [60] con-siders how to work with paradox.

For reasons discussed in the ‘The raw and the cooked’, I don’t, in this section, discuss the role of mapping and modelling, but I do give an overview in that piece [31].



An afterthought:



I recently came across a paper by Otto Scharmer and Eva Pomeroy, Fourth Person: The Knowing in the Field, in which they consider how we respond to the deeply troubling polycrisis of our times.10 I address this topic of polycrisis in [71]. Their view is that we need to “sense our own agency” as to what each of us can and should do to engage. As “mind and the world are not separate, but rather are entwined in a co-shaping relation-ship”, we can hone “trans-subjective knowing” – a knowing that has a collective quality, reminiscent of Jung’s collective unconscious.11 Out of such trans-subjective knowing, as we engage with the “social field” (similar to the gestalt field [47]) we may sense into “what isn’t yet, what is about to emerge”.12

I include this brief reference to their work because it resonates so strongly with many of the themes in this section: the idea of knowing being subjective [37], the need for stillness to connect with this interiority [38] in order to sense into ‘wholes’ [40] as well as intuit that which is becoming [41]. Furthermore, Scharmer and Pomeroy see this practice as a vital pre-cursor to action. They view such deeper, collective knowing as the source of intuiting how to be and what to do, as we engage with the challenges of our times. They emphasise that experiential knowing is not a self-indulgence or a side line but central to creating wisdom and confidence to find our personal contribution to the future.

On the subject of subjectivity



Unpacking the meaning of ‘subjectivity’.



One particular term hovers around considerations of knowing, and that is the con-cept of subjectivity.

In a complex world, as discussed in Section II, the world does not present itself as made of objectively existent entities interacting in measurable ways. There is a subjectivity as to what we perceive and how we interpret what we perceive. There is a lack of cer-tainty of perception because the nature of what we are perceiving has a fuzziness to it. Moreover, the meaning of subjectivity is itself multi-layered and ambiguous.

I want to suggest that there are three aspects to subjectivity: one centred in the person who is perceiving, one centred in the nature of what is perceived and the third em-bedded in a rather different view of the nature of ‘reality’ that emerges from quantum physics.

First, to call my perceptions subjective implies, on the one hand, that what I perceive is influenced by my own personal beliefs, sensory apparatus, or experience. For example, although we can define the colour red in an objective way as corresponding to a par-ticular light frequency, I cannot know what you experience when you see red, and you cannot know what I experience.

[It would be an error] to believe that the images that I see are in fact that which I am

looking at, that my mental map is the external territory. Gregory Bateson13

We experience more than quantities; we also experience qualities such as colour, tex-

ture, pain, health, beauty, coherence. Science tends to dismiss these as ‘subjective’. ...

Subjectivity is getting squeezed out by science. ... I believe there is a whole scientific

methodology that needs to be developed on the basis of what is called the intuitive way

of knowing’. Brian Goodwin14



Second, there is another source of subjectivity which is concerned with the nature of the complex world. Consider for example, the idea that the complex world presents itself in patterns [14]. Patterns are not definite things. Where are the edges of a wood, what is core to an organisation, what constitutes my family? And, as things change, what is actually starting to emerge afresh? These are questions that do not have defin-itive, objective answers. And yet they are more than just a matter of opinion.

Third, quantum physics emphasises that the universe is not entirely concretely there, not a fixed, objective entity. It manifests, so modern physics suggests, in the relationship between aspects of it. This is a very big topic and one I explore in ‘Smoke and mirrors’ [73]. One can argue that the universe is ‘subjective to itself’ [73]. In other words, the 160 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



reality shared by this quantum fluctuation relating to that gravitational fluctuation is different from the reality it shares with this other fluctuation. Quantum physics pres-ents us with an ontological sort of subjectivity, which brings strongly into question whether the world, at its heart, is ‘real’ in the way we tend to imagine.

So not only do we perceive subjectively – but what we perceive is itself fuzzy; and – even stranger – is ambiguous, paradoxical and ‘subjective to itself’.

These three aspects of subjectivity are not distinct in practice. The mysterious, rela-tionally impacted fuzziness of the nature of everything, implied by modern physics, un-derpins the more day-to-day imprecision of the patterns and emergences in the social and natural world. These two aspects are then complexified by our own subjectivity; we can never just be observers, as our own unique senses and conceptual frameworks impact what we perceive. And of course, in many respects, we too are part of the pat-tern.

Mind and the given cosmos are engaged in a co-creative dance, so that what emerges

as reality is the fruit of an interaction of the given cosmos and the way the mind engag-

es with it. ... Reality is subjective-objective, always called into being and shaped by the

participation of the knower in what is known. Peter Reason15



And, just to confuse things further, this is not to say that nothing is objective. There is a car outside my window and the chances are that you would see it too. The moon in the sky and the tides follow inexorably their predictable paths. Statistical analysis really did uncover that smoking causes cancer.

But, in general, in order to engage fully with the complex, open, inter-relational social and natural world, we need to ensure we do not exclude that which is indefinite, quali-tative, contextual, local and emerging. There is a difference between knowing smoking causes cancer and exploring what are the wider determinants that cause a particular group of people to continue to smoke nevertheless, or that makes them more vulnera-ble to the disease. We need to resist the desire only to give phenomena salience when they become more settled, fixed and statistically significant. It is through engaging with things in flux, with things in patterns, that we have a chance to explore the na-ture of change and becoming, and indeed the nature of relative stability. We need to be curious and open both in our perceiving, and in our thought processes and in our sense-making; we need to respond to both what seems concrete and not in dispute and pay attention to that which is more imprecise.

The sounds of silence



On the merits of mindful stillness to experience the world and find meaning.



Knowing in a complex world, as I have argued in the introduction to this section, is not achievable merely through rational data-gathering and analysis – practices

that constitute the traditional scientific method. There is a need for finding ways to sense into situations in a more holistic fashion. But ‘being present’ in this fashion is often limited by the inability to escape from the thinking mind.

Jungian Robert Johnson, in Ecstasy, talks about knowing “irrationally”, through the senses, in order to “see the world instinctively, on a sensuous, intuitive level rather than in an abstract, logical, once-removed way”.16

Meditation and mindfulness are recognised as ways to still the chattering mind and detach us from our habitual focus on the past, the future, the hypothesis, the analysis – all of which detracts from experiencing the present.

What we are trying to do in meditation practice is wake up to the changing flow of ex-

perience, moment by moment. Michael Stone17



Mindfulness is “the awareness that arises from paying attention … in the present mo-ment, non-judgementally, to things as they are”. 18 There is evidence to show that mind-fulness slows down brain waves and can even change the size of parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus.19

In this piece, I describe some personal experiences of mindfulness and their impact on ‘knowing’ and consider Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s reflections on the role of silence.

One approach to mindfulness is to sit quietly and pay attention to what is going on around you.20 I went for a few days to Exmoor to stay in a remote hut to do just this. My hope was to experience a greater degree of inner stillness and see how that impact-ed my writing. When I arrived, evening was falling and I sat on the porch, listening to the silence as the light faded. Someone had aptly left behind Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, and I read the following, written in his solitude:

This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and imbibes delight

through every pore. I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a part of herself. …

Sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar leaves almost takes my breath away; yet,

like the lake, my serenity is rippled but not ruffled. Henry David Thoreau21



162 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



As I sat in the gathering dusk, I noticed the gradual silencing of the birds in a way I that I would often miss through being too busy thinking. I wrote:

The dark darkens

An owl already calling

And still the chirrups of the day birds.

The last walker gone,

The dogs called in from the garden.

Soon I will no longer be able to write in this drizzling dark-deepening stillness.

The owl is insistent as the day birds fade.

Another example: A friend discovered some diaries of her late husband, Miles Godfrey, who, when he was twenty-four, had spent several weeks alone in a remote part of Canada. He wrote the following:

Not a plane or a boat to break the silence that must have been here since the beginning

of time, a silence with its own sounds of life and movement. A dank coolness and dull

light, the rain not falling but moving nonetheless into everything. And yet a sense of

expectancy and alertness conflicting with the passing of time. An insignificant day, but

one I shall remember for a long time; the endless atmosphere against the quick passage

of the daylight hours. And now the water, too heavy for the air, falls once more. And

every so often a surprising and expectant stillness when the breeze dies. Like a wave

the sounds rise and fall.

He continued:

I wonder how many people have felt how relative time is, as I have today. By concen-

trating on each constituent of my view, the rivers, the trees, the mountain, the cache;

each has its own life span and its own time value, from a few seconds or minutes to

ages; all is in a constant state of change at its own pace, dominated and overborn by the

passage of light. To become, to be present and to pass away.22



I am struck by the poetry and subtlety of Godfrey’s description. He notices the way the rain falls ‘too heavy for the air’. He notices a sudden stillness. The prolonged solitude attunes him more deeply to the qualities of what is happening around him.

Furthermore – and this is a point expressed by Merleau-Ponty – Godfrey’s meditative silence does more than just reveal the world to him; it leads him to insight – in this in-stance, about the nature of time, of its different rhythms and scales.

Merleau-Ponty, a phenomenologist who was a contemporary of Sartre, was very interested in the role of silence and stillness as a way into what he called embodied perception.

We must see how silence is the primordial level of perception at the heart of the sense

of the world’. … Silence is required in order for the world to reveal its effulgent meaning

… taking in the silence allows a spontaneous responsiveness to the beckoning of the

world. Glen Mazis 23

38 The sounds of silence 163



For Merleau-Ponty, it is through silence that we open the door to perceive the essence of what is there. It is through such non-cognitive embodied perception that things re-veal their true nature, their deeper layers. Further than that, they reveal “their efful-gent [intense or radiant] meaning”.

Merleau-Ponty believed that by engaging with the world in this deep, embodied way new insights arise. He was not a fan of philosophy that was analytical, that comes out of rational thinking. He promoted a naturalistic, experiential approach to developing philosophy [2].

Listening to silence is named as what is necessary for philosophy, prior to the thema-

tising experience, to open access to ‘all the living relationships of experience’. Mazis24

This underpinning of silence and stillness can form an important starting point for en-gaging experientially with the world. It can help to still the rational mind and engage more directly with what is there – the flow, the whole, tiny fleeting moments and sud-den shifts. Stillness can also form the foundation that allow insights to emerge. And, more than that, as Karen Armstrong says, it can change you.

I was beginning to understand that a silence that is not clamorous with vexation and

worried self-regard can become part of the texture of your mind, can seep into you,

moment by moment, and gradually change you. Armstrong25

Artful art



The way art expresses and surfaces qualities in a complex world.



If the world is complex, where many of its aspects that we want to explore are pat-terned, diffuse, shifting and emerging, then it cannot be ‘scientific’ simply to rely on

objective methods that assume a more fixed and certain view of reality. Arguably, art, narrative and poetry offer practices that better reflect the patterned, complex world, a world impacted by context and perspective. I was delighted to find the following quo-tation from Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers, which resonates with this view.

Scientific knowledge, drawn from the dreams of inspired – that is supernatural – rev-

elation, can be seen today as at once the ‘poetic echo’ of nature and a natural process

within nature: an open process of production and invention in an open, productive and

inventive world’.26



In this piece, I explore the role of the arts to connect us with what is there, and to ‘know’ the world in ways that go beyond reason. This exploration, as you will see, was punctuated by visits to exhibitions.



Sculpture



In 2022, I visited an exhibition of Barbara Hepworth and, later that same year, one showing the work of Henry Moore. Both exhibitions included excerpts of writing from the sculptors, and I was intrigued by what they both had to say. Both of them wrote about their work in terms resonant with those I have been exploring, such as the im-possibility of separating the knower and the known, the nature of wholeness and the importance of context.

There was one sculpture at the Hepworth exhibition that caught my eye, an abstract based on a bird with its wings upheld. The nature of the piece seemed to vary with the angle from which you viewed it, and the information plaque that accompanied it made clear that Hepworth was intending to convey this intimate relationship between per-ceiver and perceived. She wrote:

There is no fixed point for a sculpture, there’s no fixed point at which you can see it,

there’s no fixed point of light in which you can experience it, because it is ever changing

and it’s a sensation which cannot be replaced.



166 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



A sculpture might, and sculptures do, reside in emptiness, but nothing happens until

the living human encounters the image. Then the magic occurs – the magic of scale and

weight, form and texture, colour and movement. The encircling interplay and dance

occur between the object and human sensibility.27

I was also very struck by another information plaque at the exhibition, explaining Hep-worth’s reaction to watching an operation in a hospital. She describes how she attuned to perceiving the integrity and indeed beauty and grace of the operating team, working as a whole, in harmony. The quote below really brings home how Hepworth’s way of perceiving allows this intuitive sense of ‘the whole’ to come to the fore.

[...] in about the middle of 1947, a suggestion was made to me that I might watch an

operation in a hospital … from the moment when I entered the operating theatre I be-

came completely absorbed by two things: first, the extraordinary beauty of purpose

and co-ordination between human beings all dedicated to the saving of life, and the

way that unity of idea and purpose dictated a perfection of concentration, movement,

and gesture, and secondly by the way this special grace (grace of mind and body) in-

duced a spontaneous space composition, an articulated and animated kind of abstract

sculpture very close to what I had been seeking in my own work”.28

Moving to Henry Moore, Moore described the way he conceived of the relationship between space and form. This is an aspect of taking account of context – you do not just think of the thing itself, but the ‘thing’ in relation to its position in space. What is not there is as important as what is there. Moore says:

Eventually, I found that form and space are one and the same thing. You can’t under-

stand space without understanding form … to understand it ... you must understand the

space that it would displace if it were taken away. Moore29



In similar vein, Hepworth expresses the relationship between context and form, and the importance of light and colour:

I have gained very great inspiration from Cornish land and seascape, the horizontal line

of the sea and the quality of light and colour … which so excites one’s sense of form; and

first and last there is the human figure which in the country becomes a free and moving

part of a greater whole. Hepworth30



I feel, both in their work and in the way they conceived of their work, they bring to life aspects of the complexity of the world – the importance of context, including the re-lationship between ‘things’ and space, the way the knower is embedded in the whole, and the idea of ‘the whole’ having a sort of consummate integrity – a notion made prominent in Daoist writing [24:4]. Engaging with their work can deepen our perspec-tive and allow us to see the complex world with fresh eyes.

Artists in Dialogue



Turning to the art of drawing and painting, I have been very entranced, in my local town, by an initiative, Artists in Dialogue, in which a group of local artists have established connection with a number of Ukrainian artists.31 They have found a way to dialogue through art by the use of an online ‘whiteboard’. Using this technology, one person shares a sketch or painting, and others respond to what is evoked through contribut-ing their own echoed sketches and words. The expressed primary aim of the project is to connect – to show in microcosm what happens when people with very different life stories, but united in outrage and distress at war and aggression, engage. The art and the concept boards have been shared in an exhibition in the town so that others, like me, can be privy to the interaction between these artists from their very different backgrounds. The art itself is often arresting, particularly the work of those who draw from their experience of war, loss and displacement. But the heartfelt response of art-ists here in the UK is palpable too. And, as a visitor to the exhibition, it changed me, and has aroused a sort of activism in me, derived from my visceral connection to the way these artists are impacted by war.

The work of one of the artists, Svitlana Poluyanovava, really affected me. She conveys in her sketches such a strong sense of feeling – of rage, terror and distress – that her pictures seem to scream. One in particular, included in this book, shows soldiers point-ing guns down a hill, and somehow towards me in the art gallery. It is as if I can sense into the feeling of that experience, and sense into what it might feel like to be the sol-diers too. The sketch is stark and simple, and yet, for me, exudes such a depth of viscer-al raw feeling that I find it hard to look at.

This ability to convey emotion through art really brings home to me the vital role of the senses when engaging with the complex world in all its interwoven complexity.

I talked this through with a colleague and we discussed the fact that some people ac-cept the notion of a world of interwoven connectivity – but view it in a dispassionate way, as a concept accessed by thinking. Those in ‘thinking mode’ may accept that the world manifests in patterns, and may be motivated to observe those patterns, but feel-ing does not play a strong part in their sense-making. But, as I’ve argued earlier, we lim-it what we can know if our senses and emotions and hearts are not in play too. When the ‘heart-mind’32 is engaged, our knowing is enhanced and more en pointe. And art can be masterful at engaging our heart-mind. Svitlana’s sketch brings me into contact with the fear and brutality of conflict in a way I cannot avoid, and in a way that has changed my perception, shifted my understanding and changed ‘me myself’. Knowing and trans-formation are deeply entwined.

The feeling dimension is present in many situations in the world, acknowledged or not. It plays out in the boardroom, in families and in ministerial meetings. If we become impervious to empathic response, we are creating our understanding and shaping the future with one hand tied behind our back, or worse, with our eyes closed. This is the subject of ‘Thyme for a Sage’ [54].

168 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



Poetry



Poetry and poetic expression are also ways of conveying ‘that which cannot be pinned down through rational ways alone’. The Greek root, poeisis, means making or crafting.

The Dao de Jing, for example, is written poetically, and sinologist David Hinton has this to say:

Narrative, reportage, explanation, idea: language … that looks out and thinks about the

cosmos as if from some outside space. But poetry pares language down to a bare mini-

mum, thereby opening it to silence. And it is there in the margins of silence that poetry

finds its deepest possibilities – for there it can render dimensions of consciousness that

are much more expansive.33



Many people have written about poetry and the need for a poetic appreciation of the world, and I am particularly interested in the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty [38]. Merleau-Ponty explores the difference between language, “which is designed as a common tool to convey agreed specific references”, and poetic language which achieves “primal contact and a reverberation with things of the world”.34 He differenti-ates between a “communication of ideas or information” and the way poetry can offer “an encounter with another being”, a “gesture that points beyond itself to what it might convey”, and a “pre-reflective experience”.35

Poets and artists let things be, but they also let things come out and show themselves.

Sarah Bakewell36



Sarah Bakewell in At the Existentialist Café suggests that: “We help things to emerge into the light by being conscious of them, and we are often conscious of them poetically, which means that we pay respectful attention and allow them to show themselves as they are, rather than bending them to our will.”37

Merleau-Ponty suggests that the essence of what the poet or artist is experiencing and aiming to convey has a sort of stillness or silence about it. For example, artist Sarah Gillespie has this to say:

After a period of settling, several hours into the drawing, I find myself becoming absent.

In quieting myself, something shifts. … On a really good day, the presence of the tree, or

the nest, or the light on the water … comes up and towards me. There’s nothing meta-

physical or theoretical about this; it is a physical feeling of empathy … it is my way in.38



In ‘The sounds of silence’ [38] I explore the way silence can be a starting point to ex-periencing the nature of the complex world in a way that is pre-reflective, subtle and tentative. Merleau-Ponty asks how poetry can convey “the silent world that is beneath language” without destroying “silence itself”.39 Poetry, he is saying, is trying to use lan-guage to describe and connect with something in the world that we can attune to be-fore we bring in our conceptions and models. We ‘let it be’. Poetry, you could say, is

39 Artful art 169



right-brain language not left-brain language, something “closer to the truth”, less taint-ed and shaped by our pre-formed ideas. “Poetic speech … reveals the nexus of relations that comprise the world”.40



Drama



A few days before I completed the manuscript for this book, a colleague, Jed Hopkins, shared another interesting approach to knowing.41 He was interested in how a group of teachers can gain knowledge about their practice but also surface their implicit ped-agogies. He asked a group of teachers each to compose a fictional but believable les-son as though it were a scene from a play in which they played the role of the teacher. The group then shared and discussed their scripts. Hopkins found that the scripts did indeed illuminate their practice – how each teacher went about teaching, the extent to which each was sensitive to the subtle reactions of students and picked up on the dynamics in the classroom. The fact that the stories were fictional made them easi-er to critique and facilitated shared learning. But, more than this, Hopkins found that the group was able to reflect on the deeper issues concerning their underlying beliefs and assumptions about how to teach – their implicit pedagogies. This exemplifies the idea mentioned in ‘Metaphysics and chocolate’ [2], of a naturalistic approach to sur-facing ontological frames concerning ‘the way things work’. As Hopkins commented, ‘the teachers discovered a new way to talk about the conceptual framework in which teaching sits’. He felt this was transformational for those who took part.



And so …



In this piece, I have explored briefly how art – sculpture, painting, poetry and even script-writing – offers ways of knowing in a complex world. Art captures something about the holistic, patterned nature of life; it captures too, the importance of detail – the way a bird entering the scene brings it to life, the way the angle and framing of a photograph change what we see and how it makes us feel.

Art animates the idea of the relationship between thing and context, between figure and field; it shows how the actuality of the creation is relational and happens between the object and the perceiver. Art offers a way of experiencing that undercuts our habit-ual conceptualising and labelling. It does not sever the connection between the emo-tional and the cognitive, between the thing and its context, between the perceiver and the perceived. Art works on the level of the imaginative, the intuitive, the unconscious, the unsayable. It surfaces that which is difficult to surface, it handles paradox and ambiguity.

These are all aspects of a complex, patterned, processual world. To ‘know’ this complex world, we need subjective methods. The tools of objective measurement are inevita-bly going to discard a great deal that is pertinent to our knowing. And if science aims 170 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



to uncover that which is salient, that which has agency to create the future, ignoring aspects just because they are subjective and subtle, does not make for good science. In a complex world, art has a ‘scientific’ role to play.

As well as offering a form of knowing, art connects and transforms. It allows us to perceive, but facilitates a dialogue between perceptions which can then, reflexively, change those perceptions, all without recourse to concrete analysis. We are changed, moved, see differently – but we cannot necessarily say why or how. We are sensitive to the art as a holistic expression of what the artist perceives. And we are also sensitive to subtle difference – and a dialogue through art can reflect back both similarity and difference, both wholeness and nuanced particularity. Art provides a medium to facili-tate the emergence of shared meaning-making, as we explore with others what we see and experience.

Works of art can communicate patterns of culture, not only by emphasis, coloration,

context and imagery but by what is unsaid. Gregory Bateson42

Art, because it is not subject to purposive language-bound rationality, is capable of

re-linking us with our context. Peter Reason43

Holistic ways of engaging with patterns and why we should bother.



The world according to complexity theory is not just an overwhelming, random, in-terconnected, mess of which we can be sure of almost nothing. Nor does it suggest that, in order to get to grips with it, we have to collect so much detailed information that we are tempted to give up before we start. In practice, the world displays a degree of structure; it has a tendency towards patterning – like the swirls and ripples and rap-ids and stagnant pools of a flowing river. Such patterns emerge from the interconnect-edness of their constituents, their interdependency and reflexivity. These reflexive re-lationships create something more than themselves, and have qualities which manifest systemically, and exist in the pattern as a whole.

If the social and natural world tends to be constituted of patterns or wholes – patterns which are not entirely independent and not entirely analysable in objective ways, then one key aspect of knowing about the complex world is to apprehend these patterns. This does not require us to collect every detail, but it is nevertheless not straightfor-ward. Patterns may be relatively stable and identifiable, but they are not forever. They interact, affect each other and co-evolve, and their form, edges, depths and cores are not fixed, objective qualities.44

In this section, I explore what sort of processes of knowing or engaging we can use. What does it mean to experience holistically? How can our method mirror the qualities of that with which we are engaged, and recognise that we are part of this picture, not in general a passive observer?

Goethe was one of the first philosophers to consider the way natural phenomena seemed to manifest as organisms that have a sense of wholeness and integrity. He was interested in how we appraise or discern such wholes; he referred to them gestalts, or meaningful patterns.45 He suggested that we need to become one with the thing we are experiencing – through the medium of our senses coupled with our intuition. One example of this holistic appreciation is listening to a piece of music. On one level the music is just a series of notes; it is our sensory experience of those notes which turns it into music – music that has an integrity, form and meaning.

We might also ask: Is the piece of music a ‘whole’ on its own, or is the whole in the re-lationship between ourselves and the music? Are we, the perceiver, part of the whole?

Brian Goodwin, an admirer of Goethe, focused on the role of intuition in this sensing process.46 He explored how our intuition coupled with our sensory experience can resonate with ‘organismic wholes’ in nature and society.

172 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



The touchstone … is experiential, participative knowing. … Human presence meets giv-

en reality through participating in its being. Peter Reason and Brian Goodwin47

Goodwin described how he would spend time in nature, inviting the whole of his sens-es to meet the whole of what he was experiencing. 48 He was interested in what comes to us when we still our busy minds, inhabit our bodies, stop our activities and try to attune to ‘what is’ [38].

I do the same. For example, I wrote this after sitting late one evening by my local river:



The river

The stretch of river is quiet and still, the moon shines through the trees. There are

bats. Then a screech and something slowly swimming across to the opposite bank and

then to right in front of where I am sitting. An otter. It crosses again to the opposite

bank, gives another loud screech and is gone. It is a beautiful, prolonged, peaceful

moment. The river too seems peaceful; the reflection of the trees on its surface is

clear in the light of the moon. A breeze travels down the river and suddenly the

atmosphere changes. I feel as if the whole – river, trees, and me – takes in a breath. It is

as if I can feel into what the river feels.



Sitting silently in nature gives me a sense of being less of an observer and more part of the experience. I seem more able to notice small movements and sounds, feel more deeply into my surroundings and become affected by them. This deep engagement is what underpins the tenets of deep ecology.49 The premise is that if you feel your inter-connection with nature, it is much more difficult to see nature as something separate from you, as a resource at your disposal.

Goodwin engaged deeply with the idea of intuitive knowing and the need to include a place for subjective qualities in science. He was a complexity scientist coming from the fields of mathematics and biology, and he was concerned with what is omitted in the methods of inquiry consistent with classical science. He emphasised that classical science struggles to include aspects of the world such as colour, texture, and aesthetic sense and he developed the idea of a science of qualities.50

Goodwin takes the example of a medical practitioner assessing someone’s health or wellbeing. The practitioner pays attention to the patient’s subjective experience of pain and takes note of skin tone, posture, tone of voice and handshake, as well as the quantitative hard data such as temperature and blood pressure. Health is a systemic property of the body and cannot be reduced to the summation of hard data relating to different parts of the body.

As Goodwin says, what is not commonly taught to science students is the “systematic cultivation of the intuitive faculty”, which he feels can develop “the capacity to rec-ognise the coherent wholes that emerge from related parts”.51 Practitioners, he says, require experience and practice to “hone their intuitive faculty” and come to a “holistic judgment” about the problem and how to proceed [51].

40 Wholesome fare 173



The intuitive way of knowing ... is a definite way of knowing about the world. ... All the

great scientists, Einstein, Feynman ... would say intuition is the way they arrived at their

basic insights. ... The rest of us have to pretend that we’re really basing everything on

hard fact, proceeding to generalize by induction ... not seeing a new whole intuitively.

Goodwin52



Goodwin applies the same thinking to ecologies. He says: “The health of an ecosystem is reflected in the quality of the birdsong as well as in the [quantitatively measurable] diversity of species.”53



So, what should we do?



How are we to explore and engage with wholes and patterns? These patterns are not objectively existent and there is a degree of judgment in exploring what they are, what qualities they have and where their boundaries might lie. These judgements, however, are more than matters of opinion. Analysing a time-lapsed photograph of a meadow or a pond, for example would give some indication of where to judge its edges lie. It is not exact, but neither is it just a whim of the observer.

Wholes are not fixed certain things, and we need to use our intuitive and embodied responses to try to attune to their qualities. Furthermore, there is recognition that, in actuality, the ‘whole’ we are exploring is not just ‘out there’ but is a co-creation with ourselves. The whole is held in the relationship with the perceiver.

A not-dissimilar approach underlies skilful engagement with groups. Imagine I enter a room where a meeting is going on. Can I take in the sense of the group – the way people are engaging, the energy, the tone – as a whole? Can I quieten my tendency to analyse and assess and instead just attune to what is happening?

Tarthang Tulku calls this panoramic viewing.54 Instead of letting my eyes and other senses capture and categorise the detail, I aim to take in the panorama and use my intuitive sense to tune into the mood, culture and modus operandi of this group. When I do this well, it informs me as to how to join, what to say or do. I can notice how things shift as I start to interact or, equally, notice the impact if I decide to say nothing and sit quietly. Does the group shift anyway due to my presence?

A useful resource for engaging holistically with organisations is Working Whole Sys-tems.55 Pratt and his colleagues share ways to work with dialogue and stories and en-gage with issues of power. They give some very practical exercises as to how to tune in to the current culture and ways of working in an organisation, to surface sub-cultures and the less tangible aspects of patterns and norms. They emphasise that uncover-ing these norms and what drives them is an intuitive process for which there are no recipes.

Process complexity provides an image of the world as comprised of shifting, inter-penetrating but nevertheless at times quite stable – and sometimes even unbeliev-

ably rigid – patterns [14]. But things are nevertheless in constant flux.

In this piece, I am focusing on how and why to pay attention to any glimpses of emerging newness. Could it be that we can be effective through aligning ourselves with nascent potentialities? This may seem an unusual thought in a world that wants hard evidence that change is happening and does not imagine that alignment with any incipient irreg-ularity could be an option to pursue. We may be working with just a hint, an instinct that something new is here, in a sort of liminal space that we cannot pin down.

Juliana Scheider emphasises the value of noticing small changes.56 She builds on the work of Goethean scholar Henri Bortoft, who, in Taking Appearances Seriously, talks of looking ‘upstream’ rather than ‘downstream’.57 As Schneider explains: “To see up-stream is to join the arising of the phenomenon whilst downstream is to see it after it has already appeared”.58 In other words, we should be interested in watching and accompanying things as they are in the process of emerging and becoming – not just wait until they are fully formed.

François Jullien, in The Treatise of Efficacy, uses similar language in speaking of glimpsing change way upstream. He says:

Behind the opportunity that seems to arise unexpectedly … can be glimpsed another,

way upstream, that is the starting point of the process from which the later opportunity

eventually emerges. … The moment at the beginning ... was the point of the appearance

of a cleavage that caused the potential gradually to shift to one side rather than

the other.59



There is ambiguity in this process. Not all tiny differences turn out to lead to some new outcome. They may be fluctuations which merely subside again, as transient rip-ples on a pond. But the point being made by Schneider and Jullien is that by noticing early we have more agency. We can perhaps protect some emerging shoots and allow them space to grow. Or we may, in some cases, choose to suppress or ignore them. This latter is reminiscent of training a puppy; ‘undesirable’ behaviour caught early can be quenched or re-directed before it has time to develop into a full-blown problem. I am reminded of those people who say ‘this puppy is so cute he nibbles my fingers’!

So, if we can be alert to the ‘beginning of the beginning’ of a change, we may be able to influence the process, and perhaps be able to nudge it in this direction, not that.

176 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



But first, we must hone our ability even to notice them. What alerts us, as we enter a situation, that something is not right here? What makes a social worker for example, feel that the situation warrants decisive action even if she can’t entirely articulate why she feels that way? How do we sense danger and how do we sense its opposite, when there is a subtle shift in a group of people, maybe a sort of momentary emptiness or luminosity which heralds a coming together, a building of community [19]? The Dao de Jing has lots of advice to offer on this front. Leaders are encouraged to hone their in-stincts and cultivate the ability to spot signs of difference and take them seriously [27].

Schneider has this to say:

Anyone who wishes to inquire into their experience at work can practise and culti-

vate the art of paying attention to small shifts in everyday conversations or scenes as

they are occurring. By doing so, practitioners can become more sensitive to ill-defined

disquiets and potential openings and respond to them in the moment. These fleeting

moments matter, because they can be a doorway to moving on together in new and

sometimes constructive directions. Conversely, when we fail to pay attention to the

small movements in such everyday scenes, we risk missing these potential turning

points altogether. 60

Here are other examples of noticing ‘glimmers’ and acting on them:



Glimmers of change

Your child has been having a hard time at school. You think she might be being bullied

but she refuses to talk about it and shuts herself away, eats little and is becoming quite

remote. One evening she comes downstairs and sits down. Nothing is said, but you feel

this is an important moment. Can you find a way to create the conditions for her to

feel able to even make eye contact? How can you respond to the gesture of her coming

downstairs in a way that is not too obvious, that opens up the space, does not close it

down?

You are in a meeting at work where some big changes are being discussed. The mood of

the meeting is angry but then there is a sudden lull. Without really planning to, you find

yourself saying to the group that you know how difficult this will be, you feel upset and

concerned yourself, but you hope there might be a way to find merit in the new situa-

tion. Somehow your sense of timing was well-judged, and your intervention was, in part,

able to create an opening for acknowledging and imagining a new future.



Benjamin Knight has explored the nuances of how children learn, and how teachers can create the conditions for such learning.61 He remarked to me that: ‘Spotting the earliest possible signs of change resonates with my concept of ‘soon-to-be learning’ in classroom contexts.’62 He shared a transcript of a filmed conversation between pupils trying to make a rocket that could fly over the classroom. He explained: ‘A first viewing of this short episode would lead to a conclusion that nothing significant was occurring, firstly because the reasoning behind the pupils’ utterances remains tacit throughout. However, closer observation reveals that a range of learning behaviours – including

41 From morning twilight comes the dawn 177



reasoning, hypothesising, constructive disagreement, problem-solving and testing – are evident beneath the surface.’

Knight recognised that this learning was hard to evidence in a concrete fashion, as it ‘lacked structure’ and was not ‘fully formed or made explicit’. But he explained that an attuned teacher can sense that there is a move towards gaining knowledge and under-standing when it is at ‘the beginning of the beginning’ of developing knowledge and un-derstanding. He feels it is very important to trust in the teacher’s sense of judgement as to how create conditions in the classroom to enhance such ‘soon-to-be learning’ op-portunities and notes it is easy to overlook its importance.



But giving voice to difference can be a political act …



What I am describing in this piece is noticing and giving voice to something new, some-thing different. But bringing attention to ‘difference’ can, of course, be a political act. For example, at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a very brave editor on a prominent Russian news programme held up a placard behind the news-reader which read, ‘stop the war, don’t believe propaganda, they’re lying to you’.63

Dictators often take the eradication of difference or dissent very seriously and seek to annihilate it before it gets off the ground.

Even in less extreme examples, pointing to newness or difference can require a stance against the norm, a reaching for something subtle, unacknowledged and less main-stream. Artist Erin Manning calls this ‘working in a minor key’ and points out:

The grand is given the status it has not because it is where the transformative pow-

er lies, but because it is easier to identify major shifts than to catalogue the nuanced

rhythms of the minor.64



Deleuze and Guattari also talk about the use of ‘the minor’, which they define as the “gestural force that opens up experience to its potential variation”.65 Margaret Gearty builds on this idea. She asks: ‘What can you do to ‘gesture towards’, or ‘hold the space’ so that different voices can be heard?’ ‘Maybe in this ‘hearing’’, she suggests, ‘there may emerge a more collective response?’ 66 She makes the point that naming or bringing attention to something that is under the radar can give it support. She asks:

How can we refer to [these tiny shifts] or share them with others whilst all the while

leaving them alone? Is there a way of naming them that helps us to tap into or orient a

collective responsive gesture, to nurture connections not previously made?67



I am reminded of the work of Miranda Fricker on epistemic injustice.68 Fricker empha-sises that prejudice can diminish the level of credibility of a speaker. This can occur, she suggests, in reporting sexual assault or discrimination. Sometimes the issue is about the lack of available language to name or even conceptualise an experience. Fricker 178 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



uses the example of children who cannot tell you about abuse because they have no conceptual framework or language to express or make any sense of it.

The ability to bestow meanings – to name things, acts and ideas – is a source of power.

Ray Ison 69



A thought to end with



To notice and pay attention to difference is one thing, but to see it as important is an-other. And to act, protect and nurture the nascent shoots and tiny shifts so they have room to grow takes yet another step. This piece started with the question of how to ‘know about’ tiny fractures of newness. But it ends with recognising that endeavouring to shape the future through protecting ‘difference’ and giving it a chance to flourish, can be a political act.

Staying with the trouble70



How following the path with all its details leads to insight and change.



In ‘From morning twilight’ [41], I explore how following the path of what happens allows us to spot the first glimmerings of change. Equally, through paying attention to

the minutiae of experience and staying with it as it unfolds, we may also be able to spot aspects that do not easily change. These may be things that we habitually gloss over without noticing. Noticing them may lead to new insights and to change.

In this piece, I want to explore ways to pay attention to ‘the path’ and show what this can achieve.

I use as an example an approach called embodied writing.71 The invitation is to trust there is value in observing the path of thoughts, activities and feelings as they happen without evaluating or making sense of them. Just keep writing – recording what hap-pens, what you feel, what you think.72 I share here a personal experiment of doing this. I am describing one morning of writing this book, when I paid attention to the writing process itself.



An example of embodied writing

Only ten minutes in, I break off and wander downstairs and out into the garden. I in-

spect the flower beds and pick a few purple flowers with their silver leaves. ‘So what’,

I think, as I do this, ‘what is the point in noticing I am picking flowers’. My mind goes

unbidden to a recent meeting. I remember something I said, and I lose energy; my shoul-

ders sag and my mood drops. I berate myself for handling it badly. I think: ‘I always say

too much, I never judge it well’. I feel miserable. I go back upstairs to continue writing.

Back at my desk, I start to edit something I’ve already written and then almost imme-

diately stand up and go downstairs, find some chocolate, then put on the washing. Sud-

denly I am back again in the memory of that meeting, the way people were, the way I

was. Why am I returning to this again and why now, when I am so desperate to get on

with writing? I feel hopeless.

In frustration, I throw down my metaphorical pen and go outside to eat some lunch. I

pick up The Wild Edge of Sorrow73. Weller suggests, in dealing with upset, we should “stay

attentive to the minute alterations”. He speaks of “allowing things to mature in the con-

tainer of the heart … [in order to] hear the subtle character and nuanced complexities of

our inner life”.74 I am moved by this, feel softer towards myself and sad.



As I reflect on this experience, a number of things strike me. The first is that my identi-fication with my behaviour in the meeting, which I deemed to have been ‘bad’, has the sort of fixed quality that complexity thinking, and Daoism are disavowing. I felt, during that morning of writing, that there was no solution, that I was doomed never to change. 180 Section V On Experiential Knowing in a Complex World



What struck me in a sudden flash, when I read those pages from Weller, is that I was limiting and indeed punishing myself with this idea that I can never change. It came to me that this is in direct contrast to the tenor of complexity thinking which points to the opposite – the contingent, fluid nature of things. Patterns can, it is true, get stuck, but equally they can change. People change; situations change; why shouldn’t I?

To borrow Donna Harroway’s phrase, it was ‘staying with the trouble’75 – following what happened and paying attention to its ‘minute particulars’ – that led me to insight and change. Paying detailed attention can both surface what is going on and at the same time bring a degree of closure to it, as emphasised in Gestalt thinking [47].



Staying with the story in organisational contexts



I have focused on a story of personal insight and change. But this ‘staying with the trou-ble’ is equally powerful in an organisational context – working on team development, developing business strategy or evaluating a project. It can lead to insight, and it can also lead to change. A sensitive facilitator, for example, can have a good sense, in real time, of how to spot and seize the moment; she intuits when it is helpful to confront and when to support or to wait. She is attuning to the group process and skilfully using this attunement to recognise, as the meeting progresses, where there are critical junc-tures and opportunities. She is not just driving relentlessly through a set agenda [23:4].

Let me give a further example.

I worked with a colleague on a method of impact assessment that did not assume ab initio that the project was necessarily the driving force in the change that occurred. We developed a method of homing in on critical junctures.



Changing the law in East Africa

We were exploring what had caused a change in financial regulation in a country in

East Africa.76 We interviewed various stakeholders and asked them to take us through

the history that led up the change. The interviews were very open-ended. We asked:

When did the idea for this law change arise? Can you tell us who was there and what

happened? And then what happened? And what else was going on in the country during

that time? What were other agencies doing? Were there key events and key players?

One aspect of the responses that shone out was the way people described what they

saw as turning points or ‘critical junctures’. We found that people tended to describe

such moments in great detail, with colour and emotional engagement. Furthermore, it

was striking the extent to which the stakeholders tended to mention the same turning

points. Nearly all those interviewed, for example, referred to a particular international

conference, which brought together local decision-makers with others from around the

world. This conference made people feel that the project was feasible and necessary and

42 Staying with the trouble 181



was seen as very significant in changing attitudes. The way the conference was

highlighted in the narratives about the project, together with what happened next (a

number of swift changes followed this event, and attitudes really seemed to shift due to

hearing about the experiences in other countries, and engaging with a ‘critical mass’ of

key players), reinforced that this was an important moment.



The interesting question raised by this example was whether identifying such critical junctures, and also exploring what led to them, could form an adjunct to more tradi-tional methods of impact assessment. Clearly, such an approach can be distorted by the fact that people tend to remember what happened in a way that emphasises their own agency. But this can be explored by triangulating these stories with each other and with accounts by people who were not actors in the project, as well as checking out written reports and other factual information. Such narrative approaches can also explore what happens between such critical moments, what lays the foundations and creates the conditions for change. In this project, we referred to this as ‘building the ground’. As complexity theory emphasises, ‘agency’ does not just reside in the critical juncture but is buried in the way the conditions and actions along the way have shifted and loosened the dynamics and brought the system to a place where it will not take much for the situation to tip into a new configuration.



And so …



Sometimes the ‘devil is in the detail’. Sometimes it is only through following the details of what is emerging that we can understand what led to what and how change hap-pened. Sometimes the very uncovering of the detail, as in my example of embodied writing, is what leads to change. Telling the story, living the story, feeling the story are vital aspects of gaining knowledge and insight.





Section VI




Becoming Ourselves





43


Introducing becoming ourselves



The individual is a complex, interwoven, relationally shaped ‘becoming’; theories of the

brain and the mind-body are very resonant with complexity thinking.

Only someone who is open to everything, who excludes nothing, even the least explain-

able, will experience a living connection to others and will, from that, create his own

authentic existence. Rainer Maria Rilke1



If the science of complexity, the science of open systems, gives a picture of the func-tioning of complex webs of inter-relating ‘things’, then we can expect this science to

offer a perspective from the smallest to the largest scale. Individual humans – as well as communities, regions, or ecologies – are open, relational, woven, diverse entities. We humans have ‘form’ and yet continue to be shaped and energised by the wider world of which we are a part. We are not fixed, but honed by everything that happens along the way. The insights gained from complexity theory can provide guidance and insight not only at the level of society or organisation, but also at this level of the individual.

This is not to suggest that these so-called scales – individual, organisational, global – are independent of one another. It is individuals in relationship that constellate societ-ies, and societies that engage with wider ecologies and economies to shape the global world. Indeed, there are times when particular individuals and unique events can have cataclysmic, global impacts. And vice versa, we – as individuals, families or communi-ties – are hugely impacted by the norms that have become established in our global and more local societies.

In this section, I am focusing on the way each of us is a complex pattern. Each of us is unique, complex, constituted through the relationship with our environment, and im-pacted by the people and pets and possessions that surround us. We are shaped by our past, shaped by our present – yet always becoming. In some ways we can feel caught in patterns – of behaviour, of expectations, of social norms – from which, at times, it can feel there is no escape. At other times, we adapt, transform and surprise ourselves.

Sometimes we experience ourselves as a complex congregation of characters, arguing between the part that wants another cake and the part that does not, or between our tendency to be selfish and our capacity to be other-centred. Sometimes we find our-selves a conundrum; we recognise a certain persistence in our behaviour, and yet at the same time experience ourselves disconcertedly morphing and shifting in relation to those around us, responding to changing circumstances, swayed by our feelings and moods. We cannot stop ourselves being irritated by the behaviour of someone close to us, and yet we can display a sudden spontaneity of affection, astound ourselves by speaking out, or find ourselves strangely entranced by a new interest.

186 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



All the experiences in your life – from single conversations to your broader culture –

shape the microscopic details of your brain. Neurally speaking, who you are depends

on where you’ve been. Your brain is a relentless shape shifter, constantly rewriting its

own circuitry – and because your experiences are unique, so are the vast detailed pat-

terns in your neural networks. Because they continue to change your whole life, your

identity is a moving target; it never reaches an endpoint. David Eagleman2

In my explorations I have found much that resonates with a complexity perspective. For example, consider the following quote:

It is not just that we are entangled in matter—we subjects who read, write, and rumi-

nate on what ‘we’ are. We are materializations entangled in other materializations; we

happen in our mattering. What matters in our ethics, our politics, our worlds entangle

us in and as new materializations. Catherine Keller and Mary-Jane Rubinstein 3

We affect each other and shape cultural norms, and then ‘culture’ impacts back on us. What we need to decide is what ‘matters’.

The work I describe in this section brings to life how the individual is constituted as a complexly woven pattern. These ideas do not apply to the ‘outer’ world alone; the less tangible ‘inner’ world of memories, gut instincts, beliefs and fears also behaves in ways that are in tune with a complexity perspective. Indeed, what makes us who we are is a complex interweaving of the tangible and intangible, the mind and the body, the inner and the outer.

Man grows according to his interpretation of himself. Viktor Frankl4

These realisations can help us to navigate more skilfully the world of which we are a part. The insight that we are always becoming – rather than seeing ourselves as fixed, unchanging, independent units – can inform the way to live and work.

In this section, I start with the science of the brain, drawing mainly on David Eagleman. Then, I touch on the work of Iain McGilchrist, particularly his exploration of the differ-ing personalities of the left and right hemispheres of the brain.5

Next, I focus on the effects of trauma. This illuminates how the past can get wired into persistent patterns of feeling and response and suggests how these seemingly unshift-ing patterns can be disentangled and lose their power.

Then I describe Gestalt psychology; the ideas intrinsic to Gestalt psychology are very in tune with complexity thinking and offer particular insights into ways of knowing and ways to engender change in both individuals and organisations.

Finally, building mainly on the memoir of Karen Armstrong,6 I explore the value of embracing both the uniqueness of our own nature and the uniqueness of the life that turns up for each of us. I consider what it means to lead the life we have, rather than focus on the life we want.

43 Introducing becoming ourselves 187



These pieces, quirky and particular, reflect my own interests; I have followed my nose. I am not trying to convince you that any of this is the ‘right’, or the ‘best’ way to look at things, or even that it is the most relevant or valuable. I am aiming to illuminate how theories of the individual often resonate with a view of the world as complex – pat-terned and sometimes locked-in, impacted by history, interwoven with others and with the context, and yet still able to change. My suggestion is to approach these pieces with a propensity to be interested and provoked, rather than viewing them as a definitive collection of ideas, or as presenting optimal solutions.

A final note: The pieces in this section collectively give a picture of what is called a ‘strong’ process view.7 People are not fixed entities; they do not remain untouched when engaging with each other and with the demands of the world around them. It seems fitting to suggest that people are processes – constantly shaping and being shaped, constantly becoming. I find it a relief to recognise that however fixed I feel by my history and circumstances, the reality is I am always able to change – even if the only difference I can make is to my attitudes.

Brain science



The brain is plastic; it displays patterns of relationships which morph over time depending

on circumstances. This accords with a processual view of complexity.



Some years ago, I watched a television series about the brain by neurologist David Eagleman and was struck by the resonances with a processual view of complexity. For example, his description of the development of the brain illustrates the importance of context and history in the formation and persistence of brain structures and pat-terns. I draw primarily on his book The Brain.8

Eagleman starts by describing how babies are born with their lifetime’s allowance of neurons. At the beginning there are few connections between the neurons, but these connections grow rapidly over the first two years and then start to wane. As he says, “the process of becoming who you are is defined by carving back the possibilities that were already present … our brains form fewer but stronger connections”.9 Patterns of connection evolve, depending on what the child experiences and on what the envi-ronment offers; and as certain patterns emerge, other patterns that could have been formed are no longer available. In this way, the particularity of individual brain struc-ture and patterns of connections becomes established.

The process of becoming who you are is defined by carving back the possibilities that

were already present. Eagleman10

In Eagleman’s words: “The indelible, microscopic impressions accumulate to make you who you are, constrain who you can become.”11 This is an example of the irreversibility of path dependency. I explain in ‘Path dependent’ [15] that what makes things irrevers-ible is that we – or an ecology, or in this instance, our brains – can never go back to what was. As one path is taken, other possibilities fade away. The paths that could have been taken are no longer available.12

Our brain and its structures and neural patterns are never fixed, and Eagleman ex-plains that even in adulthood, our brains continue to change. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for patterns to persist, due to the plasticity of the brain. Eagleman defines plasticity as “something that can be shaped and can hold that shape”;13 so, whilst the brain has a tendency to retain its shape, it can shift into new patterns of connection.

Although the brain loses cells and connections as we age, we are able to strengthen interconnections and neural pathways through diversifying and seeking out ‘learning experiences’ such as taking up an instrument or studying a new language. Unstimu-lated brains atrophy; stimulated brains show increased resilience and are more able to shift functions to other parts if there is brain disease, or brain damage due to an ac-cident. Indeed, the brain, Eagleman says, is like a city. Its functions are not “the sum of 190 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



activity in a collection of well-defined modules”.14 The brain works like a complex inter-connected organism, not like a machine with well-defined parts and fixed connections. Its properties are not held in one place but are systemic and holistic. Continuing the city analogy, Eagleman asks, where is the economy of a city situated? As he says, “the economy emerges from the interaction of all the elements – from the stores and banks to the merchants and the customers”.15 The brain works in a similar way.

Eagleman goes on to explore how this systemic networking of the brain extends into our relationships with others, and with the wider world. He says: “Although we typi-cally feel independent, each of our brains is a rich web of interaction with one anoth-er.”16 Neuroscientists have discovered an underlying process that underpins the way interacting with others shapes our brains and behaviours, and this is through mirror neurons. “Mirror neurons are one of the most important discoveries in the last decade of neuroscience” say Sourya Acharya and Samarth Shikla.17 Essentially, mirror neurons respond to actions that we observe in others, and more importantly react as we infer the intentions behind others’ actions. It is thought that the system of mirror neurons underpins our ability to empathise, and indeed is the basic mechanism from which language evolved. The impact of our interactions with the wider world, as observed through magnetic resonance techniques, create visible changes in the brain.

Brain science echoes our experience that we are an individual, but not an island; we connect to and are influenced by those around us. Society is “built on layers of com-plex social interactions”.18 Our brains are patterns of connection that can structurally change; these patterns adapt as a result of atrophy or accident, and also respond to who we are with and how we relate to our environments. A great example of environ-mentally driven structural change is displayed in the brains of taxi drivers in London who, through studying ‘The Knowledge’ of street names and routes, grow the hippo-campus where spatial memory is stored.19



In summary



The brain, like a city or society, is a complexly interwoven set of patterns of relation-ships. It has a tendency for patterns to sustain and yet nevertheless can adapt and change. The patterns are shaped by history and context. This work from the field of neuroscience is very much in tune with our understanding of complex open systems. And both remind us that while we may feel that we and others do not easily change, that we are ‘just the way we are’, change can and does happen, and this can be aided by the experiences we choose and the people and places we seek out. At the very least, we have some power over the way we frame and respond to our situations, however hard that may seem to achieve.

What is my ‘take home’ from this? A reminder that I am not stuck but can and do change. I react to circumstances, but also, and more gradually, I develop – in response to life, and to the people I interact with, and through my own intent. How I manifest myself at any given time is relationally held. I am less a ‘me’ than I imagine myself to be. I like that view; there is still all to play for.

44 Brain science 191



Finally, I am delighted to find the similarities between an understanding of complexity when studying galaxies or ponds or societies and an understanding gleaned by neu-roscientists from peering into the brain. For myself, that strengthens each body of knowledge, and offers the possibility of ‘flirting with’ and ‘trying on’ insights from each sphere.





45


I’ve looked at life from both sides now20



The brain is asymmetrical, and we can enhance our ability to handle complex problems and

assess complex contexts through loosening up on our belief in the power of reason.



As discussed in Section II, process complexity presents a view of the world as com-plex, systemic, patterned, emergent, surprising, creative and messy. Its core mes-sage is that the world does not work like a machine; things cannot in general be reduced to separate independent domains, and logic and analysis do not lead to definitive an-swers. The world is complex whether or not we choose to embrace that complexity.

Iain McGilchrist is a psychiatrist who has spent decades developing an understanding of the way the brain works, particularly focusing on the role and ‘personality’ of the two cerebral hemispheres, known colloquially as the left-brain and right-brain. He is keen to show why we are so attracted to the hope that the world will demonstrate that it does indeed have machine-like characteristics, amenable to being understood through rational logic. He asks what causes us to cling to a view of the world as controllable, predictable and objectively ‘there’. McGilchrist addresses this question by contrasting the differing worldviews of the two hemispheres.

McGilchrist describes the signature of the left hemisphere as focused on the detail of the known, the fixed and that which is categorizable. Left-brain processes, he explains, tend to isolate things from their context and de-animate them. “The left hemisphere”, he says, “gives us a representation, a map of that which has gone before.”21

In contrast, McGilchrist describes how the right hemisphere deals with things as inter-connected, situated in context, flowing and changing, unique and animate. The right-brain, he says, is in touch with what is alive and emerging now, in all its richness and complexity; it is attuned to the big picture, is imaginative and intuitive.

I found this very intriguing, as these right-brain/left-brain signatures accord pretty much exactly with the comparison of the machine worldview and the complexity worl-dview. Whether starting with the science of open systems or, as McGilchrist does, with the processing of the brain hemispheres, we arrive at a very similar perspective.

McGilchrist argues that right-brain processing is most able to apprehend what is there and attune to the scene or the situation. The right-brain is conditioned to undertake reconnaissance, to engage on a quest to spot patterns and register nuance. The left-brain, he argues, is best at working out how to act. Left-brain processes are adept at converting into a useable map the complex terrain uncovered by the right-brain.

I believe that nowadays we live no longer in the presence of the world, but rather in

a representation of it … this representation has all the qualities of a virtual image:

an infinitely thin, immobile, fragment of a vast, seamless, living ever-flowing whole.

McGilchrist22

194 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



This categorisation of left-brain and right-brain can seem rather stark. We each weave a complex mix of ways of understanding, ways of knowing, and ways of determining action. I am not competent to critique McGilchrist’s neuroscience, but I do not believe he is disputing the brain’s complexity. He is emphasising that the brain is not symmet-rical, and its two hemispheres are relatively physically independent. He explains that experiences of people with brain damage (which points to which part of the brain leads to what) demonstrates that we have these two rather different brain personalities to call on. We may be skilled at moving between the two and we may use both at once. We can indeed, he argues, create a disposition towards connecting the two. But many of us, he contends, has a tendency to prioritise the use of one hemisphere over the other.

Each hemisphere has inevitably a distinctive ‘take’ on the structure of the world, which

is why we have two hemispheres at all. McGilchrist23



In The Matter with Things, McGilchrist develops his work on brains into a wide-reach-ing metaphysical quest – engaging with science, philosophy and art, and leaving few stones unturned. His conclusion is that the nature of the world mirrors the worldview of the right-brain. I would add that, in the main, this right-brain perspective mirrors the worldview embedded in process complexity.

The problem, says McGilchrist, is when the left-brain is in the lead. If that is the case, we may start to believe the world really is machine-like – not a model, but the truth. In that case, the important complexity, detail and nuance is likely to be discounted at the outset [55].

Complexity is the norm, and simplicity represents a special case of complexity, achieved

by cleaving off and disregarding almost all of the vast reality that surrounds whatever

it is we are for the moment modelling as simple. McGilchrist24

The problem is that the very brain mechanisms which succeed in simplifying the world

so as to subject it to our control militate against a true understanding of it. Meanwhile,

compounding the problem, we take the success we have in manipulating it as proof that

we understand it. McGilchrist25



McGilchrist suggests that a right-brain preference was more prevalent when we were hunter-gatherers – when, to survive, we needed to read the landscape and learn the habits of our prey. We needed to be able to spot their subtle movements within that landscape. The left-brain – the emissary in McGilchrist’s terms – is the tool most capa-ble of planning and executing actions after the right-brain – the master – has surveyed the scene and located the prey. The left-brain can cut through detail and make deci-sions that galvanise us into action. It stops us from being doomed to wallow in shallows and miseries, to quote Shakespeare.26 There is a danger, if we immerse ourselves to such a degree in the totality of the complex picture, that we may feel overwhelmed and unable to determine what to do.

45 I’ve looked at life from both sides now 195



Another point McGilchrist makes is that it is the right-brain that deals with values. He says that the only ‘value’ the left-brain recognises is power. If the left-brain dominates, we are more likely to see decision-making as essentially about analysing data and mak-ing logical technocratic decisions – for the sole purpose of achieving our goals. We be-lieve there is a right answer, and that we will get there through detailed processing. By contrast, the right-brain is more comfortable with ambiguity and subjectivity, can juggle sometimes-incommensurate values, and make complex judgements.

Over centuries Man seems to have found greater reward in preferencing the left-brain over the right. He has found he can win the games he plays through hard-edged ratio-nal thinking. When such an approach is expected and rewarded, then Man will focus on short-term goals and worry less about the indeterminate future. He may, for example, go all out to fulfil the purposes of an organisation even if these are questionable. I re-member a conversation with an executive of a tobacco company whose job it was to find barely legal ways of selling cigarettes to Indian children. The saying is that people in such roles need to ‘leave their values at the door’ when they go to work and pick them up again on the way home.

The left-brain is likely to feel there is an ‘either-or’ choice to be made – either the world goes to plan, or it is in chaos; either data analysis will lead us to the answer, or we won’t know what is going on. The right-brain is comfortable with juggling both qualitative and quantitative data, and with making judgements when there is a need to weigh up conflicting goals. There used to be a management maxim that, ‘everything that can be measured can be managed’. Maybe that sounds sensible. The problem lies with the fact that not everything that is there, that materially affects outcomes, is unambiguously, objectively measurable. If we only manage what we can measure, we may ignore many vital subjective and nuanced factors just because they cannot be pinned down.

Much more could be said, and I recommend McGilchrist’s writing to you and also the work of Jeremy Lent, who argues in similar vein in the opening section of The Web of Meaning.27 In a nutshell, in handling complex problems, we should aim – in first sizing up the situation, then deciding on action and acting, and finally reviewing the consequences – for right-left-right, and avoid at all costs left-left-left!



Stories of reflection



It is often my experience that when I start to engage with a set of ideas, examples in the real world pop up and provide some sort of mirroring. The first example came by way of a text from one of my nephews and got me thinking about the role of imagination in science.



196 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



String theory by text

My nephew asked me if I could explain string theory to him in a few sentences. (This is a

theory, by the way, that the basic building blocks of matter are stringlike and have sev-

en dimensions.) I answered that I couldn’t. He persisted and started to explain that he

could understand the idea of three dimensions, and make sense of the fourth dimension

of time, but he couldn’t get his mind around the idea of the seven dimensions referred to

in string theory. It occurred to me that he was doing what we are trained to do with left-

brain thinking: analyse the problem in terms we already understand, then seek to build

on the new parts on top. He wanted to reach a model that was amenable to objective

rational analysis. He was very disappointed that I couldn’t oblige. There will most likely

be such a left-brain ‘answer’ if you have access to the mathematics of string theory, but

it occurred to me that any ‘understanding’, unless you are steeped in the maths, is more

likely to come pictorially, holistically.



This story of ‘string theory by text’ reminds me of physicist Richard Feynman, who came to an insight through watching someone spinning plates. His initial inspiration did not come from the left-brain, although he certainly needed it for the maths that followed.

Some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air and I notice the red medallion of

Cornell went around faster than the wobbling. … I start to figure out the motion. … Ev-

erything flowed out effortlessly. … The diagrams and the whole business I got the No-

bel Prize for came from that piddling about with the wobbling plate. Richard Feynman28



The second example revealed itself in a wonderfully engaging book, Muppets in Mos-cow.29 This is a powerful story, and I am sure there are parallel stories from many places in the world. The example shows that change happened when the logic of the left-brain – both in the planning and in the discussion – gave way to a story which connected with the right-brain, painted a picture that participants could connect to emotionally, and aroused their values. From that point on, things changed, different objectives were suggested, and different decisions were reached. Furthermore, the change emerged holistically, was felt viscerally in the room, and shifted the patterns of meaning and connection. But of course, as the example illustrates, without proper planning, objec-tives and agendas, that point of transition would not have happened. We can’t have one without the other.



Muppets in Moscow

Natasha Lance Rogoff describes how, in the early 1990s, a US children’s programme

Sesame Street was introduced into Russia and the former USSR as a way to help chil-

dren explore what it means to live in a post-communist era, where they would likely

encounter democratic and economic freedoms not previously experienced. The story

that caught my attention describes a workshop held to define the curriculum of the pro-

gramme and discuss the values and behaviours that the series would aim to illuminate.

45 I’ve looked at life from both sides now 197



The workshop, which included educationalists and programme designers from the US

as well as Russia, was meticulously planned and well researched, utilising the left-brain

at its best.

But all did not go to plan. The author recounts a particular moment where everything

became very tricky. The issue centred on whether disabled children should be included

in the filming. One person felt that would be exploitative; another argued that it would

be depressing and that children should be allowed to ‘forget about those hardships’ and

just enjoy the fun of the programme. There was an impasse. Finally, a woman spoke up.

She said: “For decades … our town, populated mostly by Turkic people, was used as a

dumping ground for hazardous chemicals … the rate of birth defects is one of the high-

est in Russia. … I work with wheelchair-bound children every day … you can’t imagine

how much [they] long to live in a world where they are not treated with contempt.”30

The author of the book, decades later, recalls that moment with great clarity. She said:

“It was as if an angel had descended into our presence … the harsh language moments

earlier evaporated into thin air. I sense everyone realising that something otherworldly

is taking place. … We are overcome with a deep sense of our responsibility and an un-

derstanding of how Ulitsa Sezam [Sesame Street] can help fight prejudice and encourage

tolerance.”31



The third example comes from listening to an audio version of Ian McEwan’s Machines like Me.32 The novel explores the way a robot, purchased by the protagonists, a man and a woman, develops a form of consciousness. The robot declares he loves the woman and becomes deeply involved in their lives. The dénouement comes when the robot reports her to the police. The robot loves her and is driven by the logic that she will be best served if her crime comes to light.

What McEwan is exploring and questioning is whether you can programme a machine to handle complex judgements that weave ethics, justice and love and is sensitive to circumstance. There is no logic-based algorithm, no left-brain method that can be pro-grammed to make such nuanced judgements as to what constitutes ethical behaviour, and what is fair. In other words, it is well-nigh impossible to turn right-brain, holis-tic, nuanced thinking into machine-like logic, no matter how complicated that logic becomes.



And so …



The purpose in writing this piece is not to champion the distinction between left and right-brain, nor to see this framing as the ultimate truth about brain science. Rather, I find myself saying: ‘Isn’t it interesting that McGilchrist, from his neurological starting point, ends up in a similar place to those of us focused on the distinction between ma-chine and complexity thinking.’

I also note that art, including the use of film and story as in Muppets in Moscow and Machines Like Us, gives a way of both describing and connecting us to a right-brain type of engagement, as I explore in ‘Artful art’ [39].

198 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



Art, because it is not subject to purposive language-bound rationality, is capable of

re-linking us with our context. Peter Reason33

The world is patterned, emergent, dynamic, subjective and contextual. Whilst, in some instances, we can manipulate the world by simplifying and ignoring some of this com-plexity, the underlying complexity remains. I am encouraged by McGilchrist’s emphasis that there is a difference between how we apprehend the world (where right-brain pro-cesses are most suited) and how we then develop plans to act in that world (accessing the strength of left-brain processes). The plasticity of the brain, as discussed in ‘Brain science’ [44], encourages the view that we have some choice over how we use and develop our brain; potentially we can change our habits of thought.

Shadows from the past



How work on trauma illustrates how patterns can become ‘stuck’ and how they can be

loosened, both for individuals and potentially for societies.

There are instincts which are deeper than reason. Arthur Conan Doyle



In ‘Brain science,’ [44] I drew on neuroscience. Here I am drawing on theories of the person that have emerged from the fields of psychology and psychotherapy, with

their many traditions and long histories. In particular, I explore the need to pay at-tention to the sometimes deep-seated ‘shadows’ or ‘complexes’ in our own personal stories, buried within our psyches. I finish by considering the relevance of this work to ‘letting go of the past’ at a societal level.

Conceptual frameworks regarding the nature of the person have been in circulation in the West since the Ancient Greeks. For example, Hippocrates, in the fifth century B.C.E., conceived of the personality as being made up of a mix of four temperaments – sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic and melancholic. More recently, there has arisen a view of the person as a community of sub-personalities.34 Then there are models which dis-cuss, variously, the self, the ego, the subconscious, the unconscious, the persona, the super-ego, and the id.35 The common theme is that each of us does not display a uni-form, stable, well-defined personality; we can be gripped by differing aspects of our-selves in differing circumstances. Often, we experience more than one aspect at once, and struggle to work out what we feel or think because different parts want different things. And things change; whatever seems salient, unassailable and vital now can shift over time – or, indeed, can sometimes shift in a flash.

Some theories emphasise that what we become is shaped by the way memory is held not just in the brain, but in the integrated nervous system of the brain-body. The brain-body works systemically, and our histories fashion the development of our particular traits and quirks. What we are becoming is personal and path-dependent – moulded by our nature, our nurture, and by the things that happen and the actions we take along the way. It is conditioned by the norms of the cultures in which we live.



Trauma



Trauma and traumatic events can create particularly potent ‘shadows from the past’. Trauma encapsulates the response in the body-brain system to distressing experiences. Children who experience such events or have had to handle ongoing problematic con-ditions with little support, may develop trauma – and this can impact their develop-ment and their adult lives. Unresolved trauma can lead to deeply entrenched patterns called complexes. These operate like whirlpools in our body-brain neurology; these 200 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



can become locked-in and shape future behaviour in ways that can be very powerful and difficult to mediate. They can form part of what Jung named our shadow – aspects of our unconscious operating under the wire of our conscious minds; the shadow can powerfully drive behaviour.36 Complexes can be hard to budge, and yet shifts can be made, demonstrating the plasticity of the psyche.37

Trauma can result from threat, stress, or disruptions to intimacy and bonding. As chil-dren, we developed survival mechanisms to keep us away from difficult feelings, such as control, pacifying others, becoming numb, or adopting addictive behaviours. As adults, situations that remind us of early trauma can trigger sudden outbursts of seem-ingly atypical behaviour when our defences don’t hold.

There has been much interest in recent times in so-called somatic therapies which work on the understanding that trauma can be held in the body tissue. This can lead to long-standing muscle tension or patterns of body posture, such as habitually hunching the shoulders. Peter Levine discusses how animals that have had a fright tend to shake the body and release the tension; humans however find it harder to ‘shake things off’.38 We are more likely to resort to problem-solving to try to overcome difficulties and find it less easy to imagine that the body holds the key. Consequently, trauma can become trapped in the body-mind and continue to haunt us. Working with body sensations can loosen these patterns in the body-mind; some believe such an approach is more ef-fective than ‘talking therapies’ as these can actually reinforce persistent patterns of thinking.

Even when early childhood events were less extreme, they can nevertheless influence what we become – more cerebral than inclined towards relationships, more likely to want to please others than ourselves, or maybe more dominant than submissive. The suggestion is that many of these tendencies operate in ways that we find difficult to understand and consciously choose. We are driven by our animal instincts more than we like to recognise. We can become ‘in their grip’.39

‘Having been’ is also a kind of being. Viktor Frankl40



Mark Epstein, in The Trauma of Everyday Life,41 further explains that entrenched com-plexes resulting from childhood experiences are held as unformed, inchoate memories, which he calls intrinsic memories. They differ from normal memories, as they are not attached to a narrative, nor accessible consciously, but are ‘split-off’. He suggests that it is only by consciously re-experiencing these childhood traumas later in life, and feel-ing their affect, that we transfer them into conscious narrative memory, where they then can be attended to. This is easy to say but not easy to do, as we experience these split-off traumatic feelings as if we were small children, and they can feel overwhelm-ing. Equally, more recent events which mirror the losses of the small child, can trigger these inchoate memories, these complexes, and make it hard to distinguish the impact of recent occurrences from deeply buried responses to early trauma.

46 Shadows from the past 201



Handling loss – a personal example

I became particularly interested in the power of locked-in patterns in the psyche after

dealing with an episode of personal loss. This catapulted me into a level of grief that

took me by surprise and seemed to my adult reasoning to be rather out of proportion

to what had happened. My experience of these distressing feelings seems to exemplify

Epstein’s theory of inchoate memories in the sense that there was no easily accessible

story or memory attached to them. Following his advice, I tried to stick with the feelings

rather than distract myself or dismiss them.

At the same time, I found that my mind took me back, unbidden, to previous upsetting

events. I recalled images related to these earlier events in great detail – the colours and

light in the room at the time, who was there, what was said, how I felt. It occurred to me

later that I was transforming these earlier memories, as I grieved this current loss, into

Epstein’s narrative memories – memories of which I started to become more conscious-

ly aware and could then situate in time. This led to insight, and I was able to get a handle

on the backstory that was affecting my reactions. It also resulted in a diminishment of

the intensity of feeling triggered by the more recent loss.

As I reflected later on this, I noted that change occurred by ‘staying with the process’

[42]. I tried not to distract myself or dismiss all this as self-indulgent; I gave myself time.

It also seemed to me that this was the stuff of my body as much as my mind; when in

the grip of these memories and griefs, I might feel shaky or my heart race. Long walks

helped me to escape from the ruminating mind, with its tendency to circle around and

go over events, looking for explanations.



I find this work on trauma fascinating. This perspective on complexes in the human psy-che chimes with the ideas from complexity thinking as to the way patterns and norms can become locked-in. In these examples of personal trauma, the patterns reside in the intangible realm of thoughts and ideas. But these persistent patterns of our inner worlds are likely to translate into outer behaviour. And given that society is shaped by our collective behaviour, it begs the question as to how unresolved trauma might impact the development of societal norms.



What do I take from all this that may have wider applicability?



Trauma as the root of sociopathic behaviour, and how to deal with sociopaths



First, it has been suggested that such deep-seated traumatic complexes may underpin the behaviour of leaders who have sociopathic tendencies – ones who are willing and able to operate in ways that seem to pay little heed to human or environmental cost.42 Insatiable greed, unresolving hatred, or the never-ending desire for revenge can be viewed as unconscious responses to childhood trauma. Experts in trauma advise that such individuals are unlikely to heed a call for compromise, or an appeal to reason. It is 202 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



better to define limits and boundaries, and to stand up to such behaviours in ways that neither appease, nor provoke, but are firm and decisive. The point is that you cannot reason with someone in the grip of such primitive complexes.

Staying with the trouble



Secondly, I am interested in how my own work to handle loss required me to follow the unfolding of the minutiae of experience, and required me to stay, as much as I could, with the associated unravelling of uncomfortable feelings. Shifts were often tiny – a small insight, a sudden release from whirring tension, or from repetitive fixed thoughts. The resolution and change seemed to require this ‘staying with the trouble’. The idea of paying attention, when working with groups, to tiny happenings, in order to effect group change, is explored in [42]. This is a theme that is also very resonant with Daoist practice [27]. The point is that by sticking to the moment-by-moment connection of what is happening, something, somewhat miraculously, resolves [47].

Surfacing and building on the positives ...



Thirdly, my focus on personal grief and what it surfaced for me, paradoxically brought to the fore other aspects of who I am, aspects which are sustaining and supportive – such as loyalty, a dogged determination to see things through, humour and creativity. This was very important to me at the time and stopped me from feeling defeated by life’s difficulties. Post-Jungian psychotherapist James Hillman, in The Soul’s Code, takes this further.43 He suggests that we should take the time to explore and articulate for ourselves what we see as our essence, the core of who we are. We do this, he suggests, through noting our long-standing interests and recognising what seems vital to our nature. Have we always wanted to be an artist, or an activist, or to work with children? Are we happiest alone or in the centre of things? For what do we yearn? Hillman feels we should seek to surface, and then embrace wholeheartedly, the task of becoming what we feel at heart we should be – a view of ourselves untrammelled by others’ and society’s expectations, and undiluted by our own doubts and sabotages. Jung called this individuation. The emphasis is on ‘becoming our best selves’ rather than aiming to become ‘normal’ in the eyes of society.

The point is that, through focusing on what we do well, on what we are proud of in ourselves, we can build positive structures in the body-mind. Preferencing thoughts that appreciate our talents, and emphasise what we like about ourselves, can promote virtuous circles in the same way that self-criticism and ruminating about the past can do the opposite.

… whilst not ignoring the ‘negatives’



But herein lies a trap. Being positive and ignoring the negative will not make these deep-seated neurological complexes merely go away. There needs to be a balance between attending to what is problematic or difficult, and nurturing those aspects of ourselves that offer positive resources. In a society relentlessly addicted to progress,

46 Shadows from the past 203



there can be a tendency to focus only on the positive, to want to forge ahead and let the past be the past. But Jung and others emphasise the importance of reaching into the shadows and complexes, to release their energy and liberate the insights they contain.

[We must go into] the despair and darkness and fear that grips us all, and dispel the

notion that denial, numbing, or escape are valid options. Mathew Fox44

What disintegrates in periods of rapid transformation is not the self, but its defences

and ideas. We are not objects that can break. As open systems we are ‘but whirlpools in

a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides but patterns that perpetuate

themselves’. … Our ‘going to pieces’, however uncomfortable, can open us up to new

perceptions, new data and new responses. Joanna Macy45

Grief dissolves judgement, it is a solvent to self-righteousness.



Working collectively to let go of the past …



History shows that unacknowledged impacts of racism, slavery and colonialism don’t just go away, but fester for generations. If unattended, the shadow of people and of societies will hold energy in the system and contribute to the way the future unfolds. Through seeking to reveal and acknowledge the shadow, we – both individually and collectively – can move forwards in a way that builds on more solid foundations.

Forgiveness projects in prisons,46 and practices of truth and reconciliation in post apartheid South Africa,47 are examples of working with collective trauma. Acknowl-edging, collectively as well as personally, past traumas and the indignities that were inflicted on the powerless, can release the past.

Francis Weller, in The Wild Edge of Sorrow, describes the way such collective rituals can provide both containment and release.48 Together, participants can pay witness to the past, and commit to future actions and intentions.

... even when those past memories do not seem of concern



I was also reminded that these childhood memories are not always negative, and yet can still hold sway in unexpected ways. George Monbiot notes the surprising power of children’s stories based on farms and farm animals.49 As he says: “The stories they tell are a version of an ancient idyll [in which] livestock farming is a place of safety, harmony and comfort.” His point is that this warm, romantic, collective memory from our childhood reading can colour what we feel is the solution to current ills – a return, perhaps, to “medieval production systems” which, as Monbiot says, “cannot feed a twenty-first-century population”. Monbiot tells us that Jeremy Lent calls such an im-age of Daisy the Cow a root metaphor, an “idea so deeply embedded in our minds that it affects our preferences without our conscious knowing”.50 This was a new thought for me. It had not occurred to me that idyllic images of times past may be as unhelpful in shaping our attitudes as buried prejudices.

204 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



In conclusion



The practice of paying detailed attention to experience seems to reveal a great deal about what it is to be a living being. Our unique complexities can be understood as the emerging, stabilising, and sometimes burying of locked-in patterns. Despite their deep-seated nature, such patterns can be made conscious and then shifted and dis-solved through accessing the subtle, intricate-yet-frozen energies held in the memo-ries of the body-mind.

This perspective has relevance in endeavouring to change organisations and societies, as well as for families and individuals. There is power in embracing a holistic, embodied view of what it is to be a living being. It can help us to find the courage, individually and collectively, to face the shadows of the past. Furthermore, paying detailed attention to the unfolding of thoughts and feelings which arise as we aim to face stuck patterns, is a very powerful way to create change.

Riding on Gestalt cycles51



Gestalt thinking, Gestalt field, cycles and patterns.



I came across gestalt psychology in the early 1990s, a few years before I discovered complexity theory, and I wonder if the one led me into the other as their ideas are so

connected.

The German word gestalt translates as whole or pattern.52 Ludwig Von Bertalanffy53 was very aware of the connection between systems thinking and gestalt psychology. As he said: “Gestalt psychology showed the existence and primacy of psychological wholes which are not a summation of elementary units.”54

Whatever else personality might be, it has the properties of a system. Von Bertalanffy55



The early gestalt psychologists, such as Wolfgang Kôhler,56 were interested in percep-tion and concluded that we are “hard-wired to recognise a whole, meaningful pattern rather than to see individual constituent parts”.57 In other words, we see a picture rath-er than a group of separate objects on a canvas; we hear a tune rather than individual notes. This fits very much with Iain McGilchrist’s description of the way the right-brain has an ability to see connections, patterns and wholes [45]. I describe, in ‘Wholesome fare’ [40], how we can use this ability to sense into patterns and gestalts to gain a ‘sense of knowing’ in the world at large.

In the 1960s, Fritz Perls took gestalt thinking into psychotherapy. He considered the personality to be an organismic whole – embedded in the sensations in the body as much as in thoughts and emotions. Thus the therapist, in working with the client, must work systemically, asking about the physical sensations of the body and about what is emerging in the imagination in addition to exploring thoughts and feelings.

The focus is on working in the ‘here and now’, as opposed to recalling stories or re-hearsed interpretations of the past. In that way, both client and therapist are engag-ing with experience as it is happening, not analysing remembered and possibly dis-torted fragments. Furthermore, the therapist takes note of her own reactions, both of thoughts and sensations, and considers whether these might be projections of the disowned feelings and reactions of the client. Gestalt psychotherapy suggests that, by working, as much as is possible, with the systemic entirety of experience in relationship, change becomes possible.

The theory supposes that any projections and counter-reactions are transmitted through the gestalt field, defined as the relational space through which we mutual-ly impact each other. This field theory is mirrored in some theories of physics – akin to the way ripples spread out and intersect on a lake [6]. Gestalt psychology sees the person not as fixed, but as more impermanent and relational – affected by and affect-206 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



ing what is happening around her. This view has its roots in organismic conceptions of biology, seeing the living system as unified by the relationships between its aspects and also fuelled by the exchange of energy, resources and information with the wider environment in which its sits. Gestalt psychology takes this systemic, holistic view of the person and pays attention to how the client is responding to, and situated within, her environment – in effect theorising the person as a shifting pattern or process in an open system. This is very in tune with process complexity.



The Gestalt cycle of experience



Working with immediate experience centres on the ‘gestalt cycle of experience’.58 What Perls (who developed this idea) is saying is that we, as biological organisms, are continually trying to self-regulate and be part of harmonious comfortable cycles of ex-perience. If these reflexive cycles are flowing well, then, when we act, we are likely to find that the world responds in ways we expect. We feel in harmony with our modus operandi; our responses come naturally and gain the reactions we expect.

However, when these cycles of experience are incomplete, when we are tripped by some unresolved aspect of our past, then life does not proceed in such a harmonious fashion. If we can identify where the ‘break in the cycle’ occurs and find ways to com-plete it, then, the theory goes, it will lose its power and the issue will retreat into the background. It is as if there is a boulder in a river or a fallen tree that gives rise to an eddy; if the obstacle is removed, the flow of the river becomes more uniform. This is reminiscent of the notion of complexes and inchoate memories discussed in [46] and accords with the idea of ‘staying with the trouble’ described in [42]. This ‘both-and’ of effecting change through engaging with patterns of behaviour – while at the same time paying attention to the ‘minute particulars’ of unfolding experience – is a recur-ring theme.



Stuck patterns in organisations

As well as working at the level of the individual, this gestalt perspective is also useful in

working at the organisational level. For example, I worked, as a consultant, for a com-

pany in Holland exploring what epitomised their culture and how it differed from their

partner organisation in the UK. One of the issues that became apparent in the inter-

views I undertook was the reluctance of staff to share creative ideas with the Board.

Board members could not understand why they were not able to entice staff to seek

support for any innovative ideas they might be hatching and gain Board support to de-

velop them. When I explored the reasons why, staff told me about a former Chief Execu-

tive who was so challenging and critical of presentations at Board meetings that people

decided never to put themselves through that again. Despite him having left some years

before, the memory of those humiliating presentations had remained in the organisa-

tional culture and still held energy; people continued to recount the stories of these en-

counters with detail and verve. The new Board needed to acknowledge and articulate

this cultural echo head-on and allow it to be surfaced and re-positioned as something

47 Riding on Gestalt cycles 207



from the past. Then the Board could aim to create fresh ways to progress innovation in

the organisation, less distorted by this cultural memory.



The value of ‘reading’ complexity through other lenses



When I explore ideas that resonate with complexity thinking, yet emerged from differ-ent stables, I sometimes find nuance and new depth in concepts I think I have already mastered. For example, the idea of the gestalt cycle of experience caused me to reflect more deeply on the notion of patterns. If a gestalt cycle is complete, it sinks from view. So, does that mean there is no pattern? For patterns to sustain they need a degree of variation, or disturbance. This can be ‘good’ when the focus is on maintaining resil-ience in ecologies and ‘bad’ when inadvertently sustaining past trauma. I found that intriguing.

Thinking between bodies of knowledge, exploring similarity and difference, can ward against landing on tidy understandings which can then be packed away as ‘under-stood’. Tussling with different perspectives stops, to use gestalt language, the cycle of understanding being completed, and makes the quest to understand concepts a living, never-ending process.

The life that I have is all that I have59



Embracing our uniqueness and stepping into the flow of life as it presents itself, does not

mean we cannot change, but rather that we work with our uniqueness and do not feel driv-

en by cultural conditioning which asks us to ‘be normal’.

It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.60

Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans. John Lennon and

Yoko Ono



Each of our lives is unique, unfolding in ways that are contextual, path-dependent and emergent. To see life this way can feel a relief compared with the myth of prog-

ress, or the myth of being able, with a bit of effort, to overcome limitations and become ‘normal’. If we focus on normality, we may feel that, if only we could deal with our lim-itations, or apply for the right job, or live in the right place, then all would be well. A culture focused on normality can lead us to believe that, with a little effort, we should be able to do anything – and it must be our fault if we do not succeed.

From where does this idea – of striving to be perfect, or normal – originate? In ‘Uni-ty and uniqueness’ [5], I describe Plato’s theory of ideal forms and how he saw Man’s task as striving for Perfection. Perfection, like Truth or Beauty, was seen as a universal concept; this stands is in opposition to the idea that we should aim to be perfect in our own way, contingent on circumstances. It is one small step to say that if we are to be Perfect according to a universal standard, then we should, in similar vein, aspire to be Normal. Interestingly, this theme, in the early days of psychoanalysis, contributed to the split between Freud and Jung. Freud’s focus was more on aiming to help each per-son put right what had gone wrong in order to become ‘normal’. Jung’s saw the person in a more complex way – impacted (through the collective unconscious) by the collec-tive past, affected by childhood, shaped by individual personality and talents, as well as by personal aspirations. Jung’s thesis centred on ‘becoming your best self’ through individuation.61

A normative view can be both punishing and unrealistic. It can lead us to feel inade-quate as leaders, or parents – or children, for that matter – because we do not excel in all aspects of what is expected. We take for granted those things that come naturally to us, but we berate ourselves for those that do not.

The question is: What would happen if we relaxed into being who we are and living the life we have, rather than the life we want?

Some years ago, I came across The Spiral Staircase,62 the memoir of Karen Armstrong. In it she tells the story of her unusual life. She became a nun, then left the order and struggled to re-enter secular society. She studied at Oxford but felt thwarted in her academic career and moved to school teaching. Subsequently, her teaching career also 210 Section VI Becoming Ourselves



came to a grinding halt. She finally focused, with great success, on writing about reli-gion and spirituality. She has never married and lives, she says, a life of solitude. In her memoir, she reflects on what it has taken for her to embrace her unique nature and accept and attune to what life has thrown her.

She tells of the impact of reading Ash Wednesday, a poem by T. S. Eliot.63 The poem speaks of giving up on “desiring this man’s gift and that man’s scope” and ceasing to mourn the “vanished power of the usual reign”. Armstrong says:

I had … given up hope, and yet [recognised] that could be the way forwards. … Ever

since I left the convent, I had tried to be normal, to be just like everyone else. It was

time to give up ‘desiring that man’s gift’ or ‘that man’s scope’ and to refuse any longer to

submit to the ‘usual reign’. 64



The poem continues: “I cannot drink there, where trees flower, and springs flow. … Be-cause I know that time is always time and place is always place, and what is actual is actual only for one time and only for one place. … I rejoice that things are as they are.”

The poem captures the particularity of time and place and asks us to accept things “as they are” rather than wishing for a better place “where trees flower”, or wishing we were endowed with “this man’s gifts”. The poem is a homage to embracing the unique-ness in ourselves, and in our situation. To Armstrong it suggests we should live “as in-tensely as possible in the here and now”.65

Armstrong discovered that, by surrendering to the particular ‘life that we have’, there are unexpected gifts. In her case, as she surrendered to a life of aloneness and focused on study and writing about spirituality and religion, she feels she has experienced, at times, a sort of ecstasy. She says:

Occasionally, when poring over a dusty tome, I would experience mini seconds of awe

or wonder that gave me some sense of what was going on in the mind of the theologian

or mystic I was studying. At such times, I would feel stirred deeply within, and taken

beyond myself. I was finding in study the ecstasy that I had hoped to find in those long

hours of prayer as a young nun. 66

This reminds me of the notion of consummate integrity explored in Daoism, and the sense of ‘just rightness’ musicians or artists can find in their work (see [23:4]) – an at-tunement to the flow of life.

Armstrong does not believe she has had an easy life, but she suggests that sinking into where life seems to have taken her – into this world of writing and solitude – has a rightness about it. Moreover, she feels that solitude has given her a gift; her aloneness has attuned her to empathy and compassion for the world at large. She says: “Solitude is a teacher. It is lonely. Living without intimacy and affection tears holes in you.” 67 But this solitude, she says, through “stripping away a skin”, has broken down “the protec-tive shell of heartlessness which we cultivate in order to prevent ourselves from being overwhelmed by the suffering of the world”. This “identification with suffering” has

48 The life that I have is all that I have 211



paradoxically led her to joy. She continues: The pain of connecting to this suffering “is a small price to pay for the spirituality of empathy”.

Karen Armstrong finally embraced solitude, surrendered to her nature and accepted the life that ‘turned up’ for her, even when that was a life that she did not always con-sciously choose or want. Hers was not a passive acceptance, nor a depressed fatalistic stance. She was willing to face herself and continued to strive to ‘cultivate her best self’ [25]. Her example is very much an invitation to start by living the life we have and not diminishing that life against a vision of the ideal.

A more extreme example of ‘living the life we have whilst not losing our humanity’, comes from Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz. He writes of how those prisoners who accepted their lot and yet found tiny ways to stay human within it – through sharing a piece of bread or contemplating a tree – were able to maintain a sense of dignity and meaning, even, in some cases, as they died.68 He calls it tragic optimism.69

Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms – to

choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. Frankl



This brings me to a final theme to ponder: Daoist thinking is underpinned by the phrase ‘the path is made through walking’, meaning that we co-create the future through our collective actions. We join a path that already has some shape due to what has gone before. The victims of Auschwitz, or the children starving and losing their families in brutal conflict, are walking a path shaped to a large degree by others; they have little personal agency to change the nature of that path. Our lives are not all of our own making, and sometimes we only have control over our response.

I wonder, too, what causes the sense that some people possess of a desire to strive towards something. Is this personal, or somehow held more collectively in some mys-terious way? Priscilla Stuckley,70 in her autobiographical writing, quotes from Marge Piercy’s poem To Be of Use:

The work of the world is common as mud.

Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.

But the thing worth doing well done

has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.

The pitcher cries for water to carry

and a person for work that is real.

Stuckley says: “I know that cry of the heart, that yearning to be of use. In my twenties I searched for water to carry, fearing that my pitcher would forever be empty. But in the end, all I had to do was keep following what I enjoyed most. All along, it seems, the water that wanted to be carried was finding me.”

Perspectives on Organisational Practice

Introducing perspectives on organisational practice



A wide-ranging and eclectic perspective on issues of concern for those working in and with

organisations, with a focus on leadership, strategy and change, paradox, hope, and the

importance of outliers; some reflections on the downsides of overly relying on structures

and controls.



Complexity theory has seeped into my bones and irreversibly changed my perspec-tive. It offers an invitation to see the world differently. If the world is complex, then embracing that complexity will impact all aspects of what we do – how to get to know about the world, live and work effectively, design and respond to management processes, and evaluate outcomes. Complexity offers no universal ways of working; it depends on the task, and it depends on the situation.

In this section, I want to bring alive some of the implications of ‘seeing the world through fresh eyes’. I draw a great deal on my personal experience, acquired over rath-er too many decades of helping organisations and communities to develop strategy, effect change, refine leadership and so on. I share the thoughts, perspectives and prac-tices that have emerged for me. My approach has been marinated in complexity, ex-panded by Daoism and honed by experience.

This section covers a huge amount of ground; my hope is that it brings alive the im-plications of engaging with the world as complex, and makes you think. But I am not aiming to cover every hectare. I am wandering the landscape of the real world, sitting on interesting-looking hills, and visiting the odd bog.

The pieces in this section broadly cover four themes:



(a) The Pernicious Power of Machine Thinking



The implications of assuming certainty and stability.

It seems very hard, for us Westerners in particular, to give up on machine thinking. The desire for certainty, rules and objective ways to measure outcomes is very strongly embedded in our cultures. But tasks – such as planning, measuring, linking outcomes to inputs, controlling what happens next – are not straightforward if the world is com-plex. Indeed, if blindly applied, these management practices can become mere fictions or talismans, proffering the illusion of control. The unspoken fear is that if we do not act as if we are in control, then we will end up with its opposite – chaos, anarchy, stag-nation, vulnerability or even danger.

216 Section VII Perspectives on Organisational Practice



Some of these pieces explore aspects of the downside of adopting machine thinking. But I am not advocating that we should just abandon structured approaches to man-agement. We need systems, processes and rules to manage public services, for ex-ample, and these will have to be standardised to a substantial degree, such as when dealing with pensions and tax. The balance between necessary standardisation and the ability to handle and respond to unique people and unique situations is a very real conundrum. So, I am not arguing for its opposite – a laissez-faire, ‘do it your way’ ap-proach – but I am suggesting we need to loosen up a bit, consider the downsides of overly standardising design and control, and place more importance on learning, trust, and judgement. The four pieces in this section are:

Start with the hard case, not with Norm: How classical statistical thinking tends to as-sume we should focus public policy on ‘most’ people whereas there is merit in starting by thinking about those who are outliers.

Are we trying to turn machines into people or people into machines: The dilemmas of over-reliance on AI-based diagnostic tools, in this case, for those in the medical profes-sions. Can machines handle incommensurability, intuition and love?

Bending the rules: How rules that are too rigid can cause professionals to cover up any variations, with the result that the ‘system’ struggles to learn and adapt.

Cranking up control or engendering trust: Are we overly relying on rules to control and are we not paying enough attention, when considering governance, on building trust, community values and compassion?



(b) Embrace the Whole Picture



Allow clarity and simplicity to emerge by working, as much as possible, with the whole

picture, rather than pre-defining what information is pertinent and what is not.

The first piece in this section considers the extent to we should consider a person ‘in the round’ when we are attracted to his or her ideas. The next two pieces consider the importance of looking widely and systemically at the terrain, in order inform strategy.

Thyme for a Sage: When philosophers philosophise, do they leave aspects of their person ‘at the door’ and does that cause their ideas to be suspect? Do theories that emerge from a more woven-together life, from the whole person, contain more wis-dom and insight than if we bracket off and devalue all but ‘pure reason’?

Simplicity on the other side of complexity: By embracing, as far as we can, the whole picture, we may find a degree of simplicity ‘on the other side’. Grappling with the com-plex richness of the full picture may more clearly reveal patterns and leverage points, than if we limit, at the start, the scope of the data.

Strategy in context: The importance of diagnosing context and connecting to organi-sational intentions and capabilities.

49 Introducing perspectives on organisational practice 217



(c) It all Depends



Action is contingent on the situation, and nothing lasts forever.

Complexity theory emphasises that the particularities of conditions and contexts strongly influence how best to act. So, we need to get to grips with the situation we are dealing with – its history, its dominant patterns, its quirky opportunities and limita-tions, and its positioning in the wider world. What we do depends on circumstance. In part we are seeking to explore the predominant nature of the context – whether things are essentially chaotic; or stable and balanced; or rigid and locked-in and in danger of collapse [14]. We are in addition looking for patterns, and we are looking for critical junctures – these may consist of ‘cracks’ in the status quo, or places where many fac-tors cohere. All these factors are pertinent to deciding where to direct interventions.

This contingent approach impacts how to approach change, strategy, the shaping of organisations, and leadership. And we need to bear in mind that interventions in a tur-bulent world are always provisional as we can never be sure in advance what will work, nor for how long. It is highly likely that there will be unintended consequences in even the most well-researched or well-thought-through approaches. Even if we ‘get it right’ at the beginning, things inevitably change over time; new things emerge, broader shifts happen in the wider world, and people adapt. But even though any intervention is pro-visional, this does not mean it has to be tentative or half-hearted.

The art of systemic change: What type of approach to change fits the situation? When should we aim to strengthen what is there, and when should we be aiming to disrupt or even engender collapse?

The sagacity of leadership in complexity: The leadership qualities required to handle complexity require maturity and a breadth of skills. We cannot each be adept at every aspect of complexity leadership and will need to involve others, depending on the re-quirements of the situation.

Organisation: the shape of things to come: A discussion about the changing nature of organising for work and the worrying loss of middle-sized organisations in the organ-isational ecology.



(d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other



Sometimes aim to transcend paradox, but sometimes settle into the less exciting

‘middle ground’.

The complex world, as well as being sensitive to context, provides many examples where there are paradoxes and few easy answers. Complexity embraces paradox – two incompatible things may both be present and pertinent; there is no right way to do things, and, whatever we decide, there is likely to be some truth in its opposite. Daoists state, for example, that ‘the end is entailed in the beginning’ [28].

218 Section VII Perspectives on Organisational Practice



Paradox, polarities and the middle ground: Tussling with ‘both-and’ can lead to solu-tions or insights which transcend paradox and provide a fresh position that emerges beyond the beige or grey compromise of the middle ground. And yet, sometimes, the middle ground is what is needed.

Let one hundred flowers bloom: Defining strategic goals seems, in general, a sensible approach – but what are the virtues of ‘letting one hundred flowers bloom’, or of allow-ing strategies to emerge rather than pinning them down at the outset?

Abandon hope all ye who enter here: A wide-ranging exploration of the usefulness or otherwise of hope.

Seeing the world through new eyes; some simple approaches: How to work in organ-isations that are not embracing complexity; how to use standard tools in a new way.



And so …



In general, the world is complex. Even when things are stable and we are confident we can use simple methods, the world is still complex underneath, at its roots. The swans may look serene, but they are paddling hard below the surface. Relying on simplicity, or hoping that stability will continue to last, is a hostage to fortune. Something may work here, and it may work now, but it is unlikely to work everywhere and forever.

Whilst methods of implementation may often need to be contingent on circumstances, this is not to ignore the place of working with hard data. Statistical analysis proved that smoking causes cancer, for example. Measurement shows that the Antarctic sea ice is disappearing at a rate never before seen since records began in the 1970s. De-mographic data helps us to plan services for the elderly. But, as I consider in ‘Strategy in context’ [56], whilst this hard data can usefully form part of the diagnosis and help to reveal what is going on, solutions often need to be more systemic, contextualised and adaptive. Yet even this assertion needs a caveat. Some solutions do need a design which is more machine-like – for example a benefits system. There is always a tension; how do you design a benefits system that is streamlined, standardised and clear, and yet does not unintentionally disadvantage certain groups?

Methods relevant to embracing the complexity of the world are often imprecise and contextual – more about principles and rules of thumb rather than procedures to apply one step at a time. Often, the advice is to use existing methods differently, to come from a fresh mindset, rather than to reach for an approach which is entirely new. Grappling with practice raises as many questions as answers; indeed, asking new questions and different questions is, arguably, a key tool of engagement in a complex world. I hope you enjoy wandering through this section, Perspectives on Organisational Practice.



VII (a) The Pernicious Power of Machine Thinking

Start with the ‘hard case’ not with Norm



When designing strategies and policies, wrestle first with how to tackle the atypical.

Policies for public sector services – policing, public health, primary health, education – often take a utilitarian stance. The government aims to get the most benefit to the most people for the least cost. Which, on the face of it, seems perfectly sensible.

One perspective endorsed by complexity thinking is that it can be more fruitful – both in cost terms as well as in efficacy – if we focus on the whole person and their complex needs1 rather than pick off particular issues and deal with each issue separately. One way to explore this approach is to start thinking about ‘outliers’ rather than ‘norms’. Outliers and norms are terms from statistical analysis. If you analyse something and plot the results on a graph, you tend to find that there is a large cluster of ‘average’ characteristics centred around the norm; the distribution then tails out into ‘outliers’ from the pack and these outliers display more unique and less typical characteristics. In the instance of provision of public services, for example, outliers are likely to be those people with complex needs living in more difficult circumstances.

Here are a couple of examples:



Strategies to stop smoking

The UK government, like many governments, wants people to stop smoking. This is

primarily because the ill-health caused by smoking is expensive to treat, and the im-

pact on social services, as well as on medical services, is substantial. The government

wants to dissuade the maximum number of people from smoking for the least cost. One

programme offers would-be quitters a number of counselling sessions over a twelve-

week period, together with free nicotine patches. This can be highly effective, leading

to three times the likelihood that a participant will stop smoking compared to relying

solely on willpower.2 It is cheap, time-bound and effective for the ‘Norms’ – those mo-

tivated people with stable lives who find it easy to turn up for appointments and can

commit to using the patches appropriately. What’s not to like?

This norming of policy was questioned during a meeting I attended with a group of

public health professionals. They were describing the problems of helping vulnerable

people to stop smoking when they had multiple problems – mental health, drugs and al-

cohol. As they told me, people in this vulnerable group do not always have a stable home

base and may also have problems with mood and impulse regulation. Those coping with

multiple issues often struggle to commit to regular counselling sessions, and may use

patches ineffectively and, indeed, continue to smoke at the same time. Helping this

group to stop smoking is a whole other ball game compared to working with the Norms.

222 VII (a) The Pernicious Power of Machine Thinking



Vulnerable people trying to stop smoking whilst coping with many other issues are ex-amples of outliers in the mathematical sense – but they are also often seen as ‘social outliers’, indeed almost as outcasts. In a society focused on easily implementable pol-icies and easily measurable outcomes unambiguously linked to specific interventions, such groups with complex intersecting issues are often placed in the ‘too difficult’ box – too expensive to tackle, unlikely to be motivated and hence unlikely to succeed.



The UK Post Office – a public service?

I’ve had reason to get to grips with the policy seemingly being followed by the UK Post

Office, a public body which runs the local post offices in the UK. There is an intention,

so I have been told, to run down the number of post offices and replace them as much

as possible with self-service machines. This strategy – minimise post offices in other

than major towns and replace them with machines – will save money. But – and this was

our concern – at a cost to the quality of public service. The post office is more than a

place that dispenses stamps; people go there for advice, support and reassurance. Such

a streamlined approach will probably work well enough for people who are confident

with technology or, if need be, can travel to bigger towns to access services there. But it

will not work so well for the vulnerable, the homeless, the elderly, and those with learn-

ing difficulties or issues of anxiety. This group may have neither access to the internet

nor confidence to use it, and if they don’t have family members to help, can be seriously

disadvantaged. These outliers run the risk of being left stranded by policies which aim

to get the most for the mainstream at the lowest cost.



There are a number of points that spring to mind in considering these situations:

Look for synergistic solutions that integrate services: When it is possible, if we look at cost and value for bundles of services rather than optimising costs for each service sep-arately, we may develop approaches that both have good impact and offer good value for money. There may be synergistic solutions – for example running a nursery in a care home, using mobile libraries to offer post office facilities, or integrating the myriad of services for children struggling to attend school. Such service integration does, to a degree, already happen, but the budgeting for each service tends to stand alone, and the preference to link services – rather than integrate and reconceptualise – can set limits on the art of the possible [56].

Look at knock-on effects downstream to other services: Equally, squeezing or stream-lining one particular service, such as public health, can have expensive knock-on ef-fects on other services, such as primary healthcare. In particular, the outliers – those with complex needs who are harder to reach – are the very ones who are more difficult and costly to treat when health risk factors turn into ill-health. Thus the ‘norming’ of public health, and the reduction in focus on ‘outliers’ is likely to amplify the costs down-stream in primary healthcare.

If you start by thinking about outliers not norms, you are forced into thinking sys-temically; this may help to craft effective solutions: This is a point of particular inter-est; we may be helped in designing effective services if we start by thinking about the

50 Start with the ‘hard case’ not with Norm 223



outliers rather than the norms. Taking as a starting point those with complex needs could surface solutions not only to their complex problems, but also illuminate better ways of delivering mainstream services for average users.

Taking such a systemic approach would require the weighing up and weaving together of many disparate factors and would need to draw on a wide range of perspectives from different professionals and service beneficiaries. This stage of exploration can surface linkages, identify unintended consequences and may reveal novel solutions. It can allow for the consideration of knock-on impacts downstream, as well as enabling the sharing of experience from many perspectives.

Think place-based, not siloed service-based: There may be a need for a greater fo-cus on systemic, integrated, place-based approaches where there is more flexibility to adapt – albeit within established principles and guidelines – than is the case when each service is driven centrally. This is not radically new thinking, and there are already ex-amples where something along these lines is attempted. For example, in shelters for the homeless, there is often support and signposting for help with addictions, issues of mental health and debt management.

At the very least, undertaking the diagnostic phase in a systemic fashion may throw up solutions that are novel, customised to particular situations and yet still efficient with resources. Even if the conclusion is reached that it is still best to deliver services individually, this diagnostic phase is likely to throw up helpful perspectives.

These examples are from the public sector, but the private sector is also prone to siloed thinking. I worked as a consultant for one global manufacturing organisation, during which I interviewed managers in Indonesia. These managers explained that they struggled to get heard against the centralised power of Global Manufacturing Tech-nology and Global Human Resources. They told me that they were being asked to buy approved manufacturing equipment that was too expensive for the size of their mar-ket. In addition, they told me, it required levels of expertise in engineering and main-tenance that was not readily available locally. Rather than reach a local solution, they feared the organisation would merely decide not to manufacture there. Maybe that was the correct solution, but the ability to brainstorm local solutions was, they told me, hard to raise as it cut across the power structures of silo management.

The problem with solutions that cross siloed boundaries is that they may raise the threat of structural change, and that will challenge the power base. But the suggestion to start with the outliers could provide a new lens and allow for the raising of novel approaches that go against the limitations of thinking ‘within the box’.

The suggestion is to start with thinking about solving the outlier problem before turn-ing attention to ‘Norm’ and his mates. Joined-up solutions are not only likely to be bet-ter at addressing the needs of the powerless and the vulnerable but might also throw up novel ideas that have traction for the mainstream and could indeed end up saving money overall.

Are we trying to turn machines into people or

people into machines?



Automated analysis of data sets has an important role but is not the whole picture.



Turning people into machines



We are able, in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, to use the immense processing power of computers to analyse enormous quantities of data, thus increasing confidence that we can identify the links between causes and effects and distinguish pathways of disease progression. Based on this analysis, students in the medical professions can be kitted out with checklists and decision trees to support di-agnosis. In many ways this form of artificial intelligence (AI) – finding structure in big data sets – is a real step forwards. Such AI systems underpin online medical diagnostics which, through asking a series of linked questions, determine whether the questioner has a serious problem and needs to be seen urgently. This ability to analyse masses of data counters the risk of relying too much on the inevitably-more-limited experience of the medical practitioner.

However, an over reliance on AI can create at least three problems in this medical con-text. First, if, as a patient, your symptoms and your own sense of what is happening to your body do not fit the ‘training data’, the risk is that your own perspective may be discounted against the unassailable power of this body of knowledge. You, the unique, non-average, living patient, can feel unheard and sidelined. Secondly, the ‘training data’ may be based on certain groups of patients and hence may be biased. Thirdly, a nor-mative system, looking for average trends and based on past data, mitigates against placing credence on ‘that which does not fit’; hence new trends or symptoms which are emerging in the population may be missed.

I asked my dentist to what extent medical training focuses on data and logic. His view is that we train people primarily in left-brain, analytical processes of thinking [45]. We provide less help, he said, in developing confidence to make judgements when the case in hand does not fit the textbook – judgements that take into account the wider cir-cumstances and the particularities of the patient. He explained that these relational, reflexive aspects to dentistry were, in part, skills learned over time, but he also felt they needed to form a greater aspect of formal training.

Robert Caplin, in Dentistry – art or science,3 explains that clinical reasoning, based on judgement, takes place at a largely unconscious level as the dentist is interacting with the patient. His concern is that too much focus on guidelines and expert opinion may undermine the dentist’s confidence to learn through experience, and can downplay the importance of intuition, which he defines as “rapid, non-analytical reasoning”.4 226 VII (a) The Pernicious Power of Machine Thinking



This discussion – about the need to integrate the rational and intuitive, the hard and soft, the lived experience and the results of analysis – brought to mind, in a very dif-ferent context, a story told by the department manager of the manufacture of a drug called Contac 400. This story is described by Philip Streatfield in The Paradox of Control in Organisations.5 No matter how hard the researchers tried, Streatfield explained, it was never possible to pin down the process of mixing the ingredients and get the me-dicinal pellets to form in a way that anyone could reliably make it. Some workers were better than others at this cookery and they “just knew when a batch was going to turn ‘clumpy’ … or when ‘powder would fly’”.6 It reminds me of my Mother teaching me how to make Yorkshire pudding mix, showing me when it reached the optimal consistency. In the end, I knew when it was ‘right’, and still do! As Bent Flyvbjerg explains, exper-tise cannot be reduced to rules – and even the expert himself cannot translate his own “pattern of practice” into “theories, maxims and rules of thumb”.7

Experts’ behaviour is intuitive, holistic and synchronic, understood in the way that

a given situation releases a picture of problem, goal, plan, decision in one instant.

Flyvbjerg8



Turning machines into people



So far, so good. The advice is to use the power of AI to act as an adjunct to support the wisdom of the medical practitioner – wisdom she has gained through experience, through her ability to tune in to the patient – and then respond in an integrative way to the often-complex picture that each person presents.

This begs an interesting question: To what extent will machines of the future be able to replace skilled humans, and for what? The ability of AI to analyse awesomely extensive data sets is stunning. Reading an MRI scan, for example, and picking out anomalies, most probably will be achieved more reliably by an AI system than by the average ra-diologist. The ability of an AI system, having been trained through analysing several snapshots, to, in seconds, pick someone out from thousands of surveillance cameras, as the protagonist wanders around a city, is already quite remarkable.

One area that is likely to remain of concern is bias. Carissa Veliz, an expert in digital ethics, cites a case of an AI system making recruitment decisions.9 The historical data on which it had been trained showed that mainly white males had been recruited. So, the AI system, not surprisingly, preferenced white males in its selection process! This is a problem that is well-recognised and, to a degree, can be dealt with. But the issue remains that the people who select the training sets on which AI systems learn have the power, if they so wish, to inject bias in a way that may not be obvious to users of the system.

Apparently, some AI companies are employing workers to trawl through the internet to try to ensure dubious material is not mined by the AI system in its learning process-es. There is a similar issue in embedding values into AI systems. AI systems can, in a

51 Are we trying to turn machines into people or people into machines? 227



sense, make value-informed decisions, but their ‘values’ will merely mimic those they have learned from their training material.10

It is interesting to ask in what ways machines are likely to continue to struggle to mimic human capabilities. Consider meeting an old friend you haven’t seen for years. Con-tained in that moment of meeting is the sense you used to have of him all those years ago; maybe some memories – some more visceral than actual – of what he had been to you. Then, at the same time, you are engaging with him as he is now – his appearance, what he says, how he looks at you. He is doing the same to you, and his responses mir-ror back and impact how you react next. In that moment of meeting is a co-evolution of the memory of your shared past, coupled with the current reflexive mirroring be-tween you and him in the body, heart and mind. Imagine you had to make a decision – he wants something from you. Your decision will be mediated through this interwo-ven, historically and contextually shaped, reflexive interaction. It is hard to see how a machine could mimic this complexity [40].

We should never substitute a computer system for a human function that involves in-

terpersonal respect, understanding and love. Joseph Weizenbaum11

Perhaps, you might retort, you are not looking for the machine to be your best friend. If the machine is deciding if you are ill or whether to lend you money, these more subtle cues arguably do not matter. And, arguably, asking a machine to make a more ratio-nal decision on, say, recruitment could actually sidestep the inevitable biases that are prevalent in us humans too.

Nevertheless, although machines can ‘learn’ the values or express a level of empathy buried in the information from its learning set, it is not obvious how we can know what values it has introjected and how, indeed, these might evolve. And if there are errors or unintended biases in the training material, trusting the logic of the AI machine can have devastating consequences. A well-documented case of a flawed automated system in Michigan falsely accused thousands of benefit fraud.12

Anyone can write any kind of algorithm, let it loose in the world without any kind of su-

pervision or regulation. We wouldn’t allow pharmaceutical companies to do that [with

drugs]. Veliz13

Are we in danger of valuing process and logic over experience and intuition? Do we tend towards the ‘machine view’ that only that which is easily measurable, statistically significant, and clearly linked to inputs can be used in decision-making? It is easy to devalue our human ability to handle complex information. We may take for granted the way we can skilfully and almost miraculously weave and balance together objec-tive ‘fact-based’ analysis, with subjective, qualitative perspectives and weigh up some-times-incommensurable values. Do we run the risk, first, of emulating machines, and then allowing machines to replace us? Do we remain in thrall to the ‘machine world-view’ and continue to distrust our natural ability to handle life’s rich complexity?

Bending the rules



Where you need to have rules, don’t make it impossible to challenge them.



In 2005, during Hurricane Katrina, a public-minded pharmacist broke into sever-al pharmacies before they were flooded and removed morphine and other serious

drugs. He took them to a place of high ground so he could provide them to the am-bulance and fire services who were rescuing people. Of course, he was breaking the rules. In the same year, four suicide bombers struck London’s transport network. At one point, it was reported that there were sounds of screaming from further along the tunnel but the men in the rescue service were reluctant to advance without formal permission. Someone jumped onto the line to show it was not live and to urge them on – but they found breaking the rules hard to do.

Another story: A research colleague tells of a social worker who is called out to a child one Sunday evening and feels she is in immediate danger. The social worker is not al-lowed just to remove her but is concerned that the situation is so grave that he should not wait for due procedure. In the end, he phones a friend who runs a hostel and takes the child there. He is in serious breach of the rules. When he writes his report, he hides this ‘misdemeanour’.

The research colleague found this example was not uncommon. Reports tend to be written in a rule-abiding way because the consequences of breaking the rules, even with good reason, are career-limiting. The learning that could have arisen about the case, and the potential for shifting procedure to accommodate such anomalies, did not happen. When the researcher raised this with managers in the service, they told him their own tales of having to conform, or pretending to conform, to rules which some-times ran counter to good judgement. The implication seems to be that we build an un-bending block of rules which can never adapt, as any rule-breaking tends to be hidden from sight.

I have been reading Call the Midwife – reminiscences of a midwife working in East London in the 1950s.14 The midwives followed procedures but were equally encour-aged to improvise when the social circumstances made that impossible. They were ap-plauded for using their initiative and did not fear being disciplined if they had to take some risks as they struggled to deal with real-world situations. Equally, the procedure manual was regularly updated as the team shared and learned from the practical ex-amples of working in the community. Has it been an improvement to move to a more rule-based approach?



230 VII (a) The Pernicious Power of Machine Thinking



Encouraging judgement, creativity and caring



The dominant paradigm in the West is that the way to efficiency and quality is through the design of and adherence to detailed, clear ways of working which can be monitored and measured. Procedures are, without doubt, necessary, but are we paying sufficient attention to encouraging employees to use their judgement to deal with situations as they present themselves? Is there the space to develop creativity? Do we value the talent, commitment and experience of professional people or do employees feel that they must not deviate from procedure to such an extent that they start to leave their creativity, compassion and humanity at the door? And, furthermore, are we embedding a system which cannot learn – as any deviation from the rules is so frowned upon it has to be hidden?



An afterthought:



These are not new thoughts. Peter Senge’s The Fifth Discipline15 which introduced ‘the learning organisation’, came from very much from the same viewpoint as I am express-ing here.

The [Learning Organisation] was a compelling vision of an organization made up of em-

ployees skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge. These people could

help their firms cultivate tolerance, foster open discussion, and think holistically and

systemically. Such learning organizations would be able to adapt to the unpredictable

more quickly than their competitors could.16



However, a recent review of learning organisations concludes that the vision of their uptake has not been realised due to the desire to proceduralise and institute such learning processes, then measure their impact and show how learning contributed to the overall strategic goals.17 In other words, it has largely failed because managers wanted to take a living, creative, relational learning process and insert it into the usual mechanical box, constrained by rules.





53


Cranking up control or engendering trust?



Engendering adaptation, trust and humanity can be more effective than tightening the

controls on the machine.



The dominant Western paradigm, when it comes to designing and running manage-ment practices in the public sector in particular, is to believe that efficiency and effectiveness is best met through standardisation, defining objective measures and seeking hard evidence. The UK seems to have a particular liking for standardisation and simple measures. For example, the UK school inspection regime confers a one-word assessment on a school after a two-day inspection – outstanding, good, ade-quate, or failing.18 The stress caused to head teachers is legendary, as the implications of being awarded a ‘bad’ label are far-reaching.19 One friend who is a UK Head Teacher confesses that as well as coping with the huge anxiety of waiting for the inspection, she does not feel it conveys a fair representation of the qualities of a school. She urges prospective parents, whatever the outcome of the official process, to visit the school of interest, meet the staff and parents, and gain their own sense as to whether children seem happy, motivated and safe.



Holistic teaching



By contrast, Finland’s approach to education appears to be more holistic.20 It “breaks the boundaries of existing subjects” through cross-disciplinary projects involving the wider community, such as measuring the water quality of a lake. There are no standard tests and no school inspections. Teachers have freedom in the classroom to experiment and find ways of teaching that work for themselves and their pupils.21 The espoused philosophy is that you invest in educating and encouraging good teachers – and then you trust them.

Three important aspects of the Finnish System compared with general Western model:

flexibility and diversity rather than standardization, emphasis on broad knowledge includ-

ing all aspects of individual growth and learning, and culture of trust through profession-

alism. Ustun and Eryilmaz 22



Olli-Pekka Heinonen, Director of The Finnish National Agency for Education, talks about “giving children the ability to cope in the future, a future that we adults cannot imagine” and says the emphasis is not on learning facts but learning through play and experience.

Finnish education, with its focus on preparing students to handle an uncertain future and on learning how to learn, is a good example of adopting a complexity mindset. A key question is to ask whether this looser, trust-based, contextual approach results in 232 VII (a) The Pernicious Power of Machine Thinking



a compromise of standards. The statistics say otherwise.23 Finland scores higher than the UK on numeracy, literacy and other educational outcomes.24 And, regarding chil-dren’s happiness, Finland scores near the top of the ratings for Europe and the UK is at the bottom.25 Interestingly, Finnish children also start school later than in the UK and have shorter school days.

A word of warning, though: A colleague, Mike Collins, working in educational research told me that recently Finland’s ratings are starting to drop a little and the UK’s rat-ings on numeracy and literacy have been going up. Why is that? Has the UK moved more towards a more holistic adaptive approach? Have UK teachers increasingly gone their own way and usefully ‘bent the rules’? Has the top-down prioritising in the UK of numeracy and literacy showed some return? Or have other social factors negatively impacted Finnish children? Teasing out how outcomes emerge is a complex issue, and neat expositions are always to be treated with caution. Mike was emphatic, however, that holistic teaching coupled with adapting to the uniqueness of particular groups of students, does tend to be more effective than too great a reliance on standardisation and simplistic controls.



Natural governance in healthcare



To turn to another example, another colleague, Aine Carroll, working in the health sec-tor, described her despair over the response to an awful situation in a UK hospital, in which a nurse murdered a number of babies over a period of several months.26 ‘It’s not the first time such an awful thing has happened’, she said, ‘but the policy response is always the same; to crank up the rules, checks and protocols’.27 She continued: ‘I have no confidence this really works. We need a fresh approach, one that takes into account the complexities of the situation, one that is more human.’

We agreed that what is needed is the development of a form of natural governance with an emphasis on developing principles rather than rules, building stronger more supportive teams, and at the same time making it more acceptable to voice concerns.28 It reminds me of the saying, ‘it takes a village to raise a child’ – meaning that respon-sibility is shared, parental behaviour is legitimately challenged, and problems are not just exported upwards to ‘the system’.

Natural governance is an emergent process generated through the reflexive interac-

tion of multiple stakeholders, coupled with enabling constraints, the creation of ‘adap-

tive space’ to facilitate processes of feedback, sensemaking and reflection. Carroll29



One model, from a very different setting, but also dealing with issues of safety, sug-gests that a culture needs to be engendered which is ‘just’ (defined as a culture which creates “an atmosphere of trust where people are encouraged and even rewarded for sharing safety-related information”), flexible, supports learning and encourages staff to ask ‘what if’.30 This seems a good starting point to consider how to implement natu-ral governance.

53 Cranking up control or engendering trust? 233



Dealing with falls

Following complaints, a hospital undertook an experiment in group-based natural gov-

ernance, aimed at reducing falls.31 This was led by a senior nurse, who worked along-

side other nurses to open up conversations, coach them and review any incidents. The

senior nurse would ask questions of her colleagues such as: ‘What do you think would

happen if you left the frail elderly person alone on the toilet’, or ‘what do you think your

colleagues were doing at the time’, or ‘is that the kind of care you would have want-

ed for your Mother’? The idea was to help people think through consequences and see

things through others’ eyes, and, in so doing, reflexively shift the culture to one which

grappled more comfortably with the tensions between mutual support and trust, care

for patients, and willingness to ‘call out’ and challenge each other. Apparently, over the

course of the first year, the number of falls reduced by thirty percent.32 Unfortunately, a

few years later, the senior nurse’s time was redirected away from coaching and towards

writing incident reports, as these provide more tangible, measurable evidence that ac-

tion was being taken. Fall rates started to rise again.



It sometimes feels that structured aspects of organisational life – planning, setting objectives, writing reports, measuring outcomes – take over from nurturing the rich potential of human warmth and creative endeavour. The structures and strictures of machine management dominate. But herein lies a danger: If we feel treated like bits of a machine, we start to act accordingly. We save our humanity and creativity for our life ‘outside’. We start to turn up at work and just do what is asked or respond to what will be measured – no matter how uninspiring, how pointless, or, indeed, how risky we sometimes feel it is.

Do we need to review, in governance processes, the balance between structuring and ‘culturing’? Would not a greater focus on engendering a ‘just’ culture of support, agility and caring actually create safer environments and better outcomes than relying pri-marily on processes, reports and numbers?

Thyme for a Sage?



Be cautious of the elegance of the Thinker and look for the more complex, tender, embodied

wisdom of the Sage.



The life experience of a philosopher or thinker will inevitably colour his or her the-ories in ways that are not immediately obvious. And whilst we are all, inevitably, blind to some of our prejudices or predilections, these sometimes-hidden aspects are important to dig for. Complexity theory suggests that ‘all that we are’, acknowledged or not, will shape our ideas and philosophies. Thus, should we not take into account the path of the philosopher’s life, the way he or she has lived, when we engage with and evaluate his or her philosophies?

I’m going to take a particular example, and that is Martin Heidegger. Heidegger devel-oped his seminal work in the 1920s in Germany. I don’t find his writing easy to follow, and I certainly cannot do it justice here, but one central theme developed in Being and Time was to explore the essence of ‘beingness’, the nature of existence.33 He advocated that this was undertaken through paying attention to experience in the ‘here and now’. He also stated that “before you knew the truth about things, you have to care about them”.34 Caring, he said, is what motivates us to explore and take notice, in order not to be blind to key aspects.

These are important ideas and fit well with the admonition, from complexity thinking, to see things in context and to see things in relationship. But … Heidegger was a Nazi and was anti-Semitic. His black notebooks, published in 2014, way after his death, leave no doubt as to his deep-seated anti-Jewish stance. As he shows in his notebooks, he saw Jews as both racist and rootless – and even suggested their own racism was to blame for their treatment during the holocaust. “Jews, he writes are ‘uprooted from Being-in the World’ – that is [they are] incapable of authentically caring and knowing”.35

The question this raised, when these notebooks were published, was whether his seemingly profound anti-Semitic views bring into question his work in general. Can you carve off the bits of him you don’t like and keep the rest? Or, as someone said at a panel discussion in the US on Heidegger and Nazism soon after the publication of the notebooks, “anyone who is capable of that sort of argument cannot be trusted to think”.36

I find Heidegger’s work rather abstract and disembodied, and yet, paradoxically, the focus of his philosophy is phenomenological – advocating the paying of attention to the relational particularity of immediate experience. It is as if he ‘thinks about’ experience ‘top-down’ rather than reflects on experience ‘bottom up’. Richard Bernstein, in The New Constellations, expresses the same concern.37 He argues that Heidegger relied on 238 VII (b) Embrace the Whole Picture



‘thinking’ and ignored phronesis, Aristotle’s term for learning through paying detailed attention to our involvement in the world.

I wonder if I can trust the philosophical ideas of someone who wrote about compassion and connection and yet deemed them not to apply to a particular group of people, in this case, the Jews. And this is despite him having colleagues, friends and indeed a lover who were Jewish.

Often what is thought is less important than who thinks it. Carl Jung38

We need to recognise the knower in generating knowledge. Guy Loubser39

Would I throw away everything Heidegger thought? No. But would I rather trust the ideas of some of his contemporaries who wove their life experience into their ideas and showed themselves in their writing – such as Hannah Arendt40 or Philippa Foot41 – then yes. Arendt’s wisdom is less polished, less elegant, more ambiguous, more caveated – but, to me, feels more whole, more to be trusted. I would suggest that wisdom is an emergent aspect of the systemic nature of who we are and how we live. Relying pri-marily on the logic of the abstract mind and theorising from there is, perhaps, like mak-ing a cake without all the ingredients.

Thinking analytically is like going on a diet. Its aim is a healthy austerity of thought, a

certain trimness of mind. But when it’s carried too far, we are left with only a skeleton.42



Conversely, if we actively cultivate what the Chinese call xin or heart-mind, if we con-sciously marinate our ideas in lived experience, won’t this enrich and infuse our in-sights and philosophical conclusions [25]?

Freya Mathews is thinking along the same lines. She says:

The Theorist picks out concepts from his thinking and “by further abstraction, sharpens

them into well-defined abstract categories”. In so doing, he “shifts the focus from the

world itself” and, “in accordance with abstract principles of inference and evidence”,

develops a schema that is then “judged to be true”.43

Mathews contrasts the Theorist with the Sage and suggests that the Sage “focuses not on abstract schemas at an inner remove from reality but on the immediate field of ac-tual, outer influences and concrete particulars in which he is immersed”.44

Should we not be wary of the sometimes-gripping, analytically elegant, sophisticated and well-argued philosophies of the abstract Theorist, even if they excite us? Wouldn’t we do better to trust the more tentative but maybe more holistic offerings of the Sage who develops wisdom using the heart-mind, and who brings her ‘lived life’ into the de-velopment of her insights and perspectives? I leave the question with you.

Simplicity on the other side of complexity



Keep the diagnostic broad, rich and complex; then how best to intervene may reveal itself as

surprisingly obvious.

For the simplicity on this side of complexity, I wouldn’t give you a fig. But for the sim-

plicity on the other side of complexity, for that I would give you anything I have. Oliver

Wendell Holmes Sr.



It is tempting to simplify a problem at the outset to try to make it tractable. We tend to define boundaries and limit the types of information we deem relevant. But what

if, in so doing, we run the risk of throwing out the baby with the bathwater? What if we make it harder to apprehend the features, patterns, nodes and discontinuities that we are trying to uncover – those features that will aid both understanding and action? The complexity worldview suggests that it is through engaging with as complete a picture of a situation as we can, that the relative simplicity of its features may be revealed. And then, by working with this relative simplicity, we are most likely to home in on what is there and let that guide us as to where best to intervene. This is what is meant by the ‘simplicity on the other side of complexity’.

As an analogy, imagine you have only a grainy, monochrome, cropped picture of a land-scape. There might be a building in that shadow from the hill, but nothing is clear. But if you were able to widen the boundaries of the picture, as well as increase the pixel den-sity and maintain the whole range of colour, you might suddenly see that the picture has two key potentially connected features – a crevasse right over on one side which might just, if it widens, threaten the farmhouse that was indeed lurking in the shadow of the hill. Now, you can assess this dilemma and decide what to do. The complex messy data resolved itself, in this instance, into two key objects – crevasse and farmhouse.

How does this translate into a practical example? Imagine a company is exploring a new market for washing powder in Asia. It might seem sufficient to focus on the current market – competition, demographics of the customer base, supply chain options and so on. But if that perspective is widened to include, for example, the geo-politics of the broader region, together with immigration policy and food security, such a broader perspective may point to unexpected opportunities or threats; it may also reveal ways in which the socio-politico-economic landscape is stable or unstable. Such features might have been missed if the approach had focused too narrowly on the more imme-diate issues of the market. The ‘patterns in the landscape’ come, in this example, not from economic factors on their own, nor from features in the washing powder market per se, but from the systemic interplay of the economic, the political and the environ-mental.

Such an approach will require many types of data and many perspectives; it requires judgement, and it is imprecise and subjective. But to simplify at the start and then 240 VII (b) Embrace the Whole Picture



work analytically with a restricted data set can make us precisely wrong! In contrast, to open up to a richer, more inclusive perspective which allows systemic patterns and systemic features to be seen may reveal opportunities and stumbling blocks not apparent through more conventional analysis.

In surveying the complex picture that comes from such an inclusive and far-reaching exploratory phase, in seeking patterns and resonances, nodes and leverage points, it can become clearer what is stuck, what is fluid, where there are entry points, and where there be dragons!

Strategy in context



How to approach strategy development in a complex, dynamic uncertain world.

How to deal with an emerging future and recognise that the realised strategy is never

what was intended.



When I ask managers whether the strategic plans in which they have been involved delivered on their goals, the vast majority say no. When I ask why not, they play back to me a scenario of new entrants, shifting markets and contexts, lightning bolts from left field, and opportunities or threats that either had been overlooked or were newly emerging. In other words, they surface a complexity worldview of the context in which their strategies were enacted.

There is a theme running through the whole strategy process, but it often lurks beneath the surface. It is the tension between the desire to control what unfolds – through set-ting goals, creating plans and undertaking analyses – and the unpredictable reality of change in complex situations. Indeed, the strategy process is replete with paradox. However well we understand the terrain, things will change; however much we artic-ulate strategy, what is enacted will differ from what was intended; and however thor-ough we are at matching opportunities to our capabilities, our ability to spot emerging shifts in the market, and adapt to them, may in practice trump everything else.

But despite operating in a dynamic and fast-changing world, we do need to decide, as best we can, how to start, and where we hope to go. We have to acquire resources and capabilities, and provide a degree of clarity of role and purpose. We have to be adept at determining where we are going, and be equally adept, when circumstances require it, at adapting.

I start with the issue of diagnosing the context, then consider how to build on that di-agnosis to develop the initial strategy. But this strategy can only be the starting point. How can we adapt to an emerging future, and accept that what strategy is realised in practice will be neither what was hoped for nor what was planned?



Diagnosing the context in a complex world



Do organisations spend enough time getting to grips with the ‘terrain’ before deciding on a course of action? In ‘Simplicity on the other side of complexity’ [55] I consider the importance of widening the view, in order to reveal systemic patterns and features. Here I take things a bit further.

The insights from complexity thinking concerning the nature of this terrain are that it is:

242 VII (b) Embrace the Whole Picture



• patterned: the context – the market, the society, the environment – shows up in

systemically woven patterns.

• featured: there may be quirky opportunities, hiding in plain sight, some of which

might be newly emerging; there might also be a few chasms.

• dynamic: the context is rarely static and sometimes changes rapidly and radically.



A great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not deciding

what to do but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.

Richard Rumelt45



This diagnostic phase – arguably the most important part of the strategy or change process – begins with ‘pattern-spotting’. We need to view the terrain systemically and as widely and comprehensively as possible to spot the systemically woven patterns that, as I have argued in [14], constitute that terrain. In addition, we need to be able to spot movement and get to know the terrain so well that we can spot any minor changes [41] – any cracks or developing new shoots, or leverage points – which may confer advantage.46

Get the beat … listen to the wisdom of systems. Donella Meadows47



Start with the past



The past is an important place to start when looking at dynamic, ever-changing contexts, for several reasons:

First, it contains nuggets of wisdom. It isn’t just a dark country from which we have escaped. We can mine it for good ideas and take heart that if we could do it then, we can do it now.

Secondly, history can illustrate what might happen in the future. Histories of the rise and fall of empires, for example, show the extent to which very similar factors tend to trigger their downfall and display the common features in what tended to happen post-collapse [see 68: history’s crisis detectives].

Thirdly, the past, in many ways, lives on in the present. Unresolved conflicts can fes-ter under the surface and erupt at a later stage. Equally, cultures that have displayed ethnic concord over centuries will have the memory of that tolerance in their cultural psyches, even if it seems to have gone underground. Gathering information about the past enriches our knowledge of the terrain of the present – the depth of its valleys and the extent of its quagmires.

Finally, paying attention to the past can save time. Talking to people who have left an organisation or moved within an organisation can provide learning, contacts, old reports and stories of pitfalls and successes. These can really enrich understanding.

56 Strategy in context 243



Pay attention to the dynamic



The point at which the importance of viewing the dynamics of situations came home to me was when I came across the idea of fragile states.



Fragile states

A fragile state is a regime which is unstable and at risk of internal conflict or collapse.

There are published indexes which grade the fragility of countries.48 The characteristics

on which the grade is based include governance – either weak central government or

one which has little legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens; lack of public investment in

infrastructure; failure to establish rule of law and instability; and significant shifts in

economic trends.

Around the time of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, Syria was deemed, in these index-

es, to be stable. But then conflict broke out. This was initiated by violent crackdowns on

youths demanding greater democracy. But there was also an emerging perfect storm

caused by the drought of 2012 and loss of livelihoods for farmers in the Southeast, cou-

pled with the loss of a social ‘safety net’, all entwined with the desire for democracy. This

loss of safety net was due to a shift, over time, towards free market ideologies and an

associated minimising of state support. The conflict also became mired in a much wider

set of interests of other states and extreme religious groups. So, when viewed systemi-

cally and historically, the potential for instability becomes much more visible.



It is always easy to comment in hindsight, but this example of evaluating whether a state is fragile gives a good example of the way that developing a systemic, historical and dynamic perspective can offer a richer picture of the situation. It makes more prominent, perhaps, the systemic determinants of fragility rather than the signs or mea-sures of stability.

I’m suggesting, in similar vein, that for organisations developing strategy, a diagnosis that incorporates the past and also views things systemically and dynamically, can provide an essential perspective. It allows judgement as to what is stable, what is deeply entrenched, what may be unravelling and where there may be new opportuni-ties and threats.

In The Five Percent, Peter Coleman explores ways, through working systemically, to find solutions to seemingly impossible conflicts. His advice, relevant in the broader field of strategy too, is to:

See the system. When you find yourself stuck in an oversimplified polarized conflict,

a useful first step is to try to become more aware of the system as a whole, to provide

more context to your understanding of the terrain in which the stakeholders are em-

bedded, whether they are disputants, mediators, negotiators, lawyers, or other third

parties. This can help you to see the forest and the trees; it is a critical step toward

regaining some sense of accuracy, agency, possibility, and control in the situation.49 244 VII (b) Embrace the Whole Picture



Building on the diagnosis to create an adaptive strategy



We start with a divergent diagnostic phase and welcome the whole messy complex interwoven picture; we then look to uncover its features. We use it to build a strategy that will reflect and respond to the patterns and dynamics in both the organisation and its context. In a nutshell, we need to match the opportunities and threats brought to light by the diagnostic with the capabilities, intentions and values of the organisation.50

But there is a dilemma here. If the strategy becomes too fixed, it can blind organisa-tions to new information, new opportunities and changing contexts. However, if the strategy is too loose, how can organisations amass resources, create clarity for its staff and boldly step into the market? The balance between direction and adaptation is the paradoxical conundrum in a dynamic complex world. For we want to do more than re-spond to changing circumstances, we want to shape the future too.

We need to view the world as continuously producing newness, within which we cre-

ate patterns of relative stability. Bill Sharpe51



We have to build into our strategic processes ways to continually engage with the un-folding future; in that way we continue to notice - as new information emerges and as actions have an impact – and keep on reviewing the whole picture. We must keep an eye out for any ‘weak signals’ of change or opportunity. This process is never-ending.

We can never be sure about the future. We often have to make some leaps of faith in order to proceed. It can sometimes be preferable to try out reasonably well-informed hunches than to put all our efforts in to analysing available information for the pur-poses of predicting the future. This is particularly pertinent when asking for opinions about products or services that are radically new. In this territory of ‘unknown un-knowns’ predicting the future is almost never effective, as discussed by Christensen, in The Innovator’s Dilemma.52

We must move forwards and yet, at the same time, expect the unexpected. The entre-preneur knows this well. Many entrepreneurs have strong hunches and develop strong intentions. Yet they seem able to flex their activities to achieve their visions, and also modify those visions if other opportunities arise, or if there are unexpected difficulties. Many entrepreneurs have many failures as well as successes and, even if successful, have very diverse portfolios. It is the act of balancing opportunity and intention that seems to be key.



And/but what gets enacted in practice?



As well as recognising that the external world is dynamic and changing, we are also dealing with the complexities of the organisation that created the strategy. What

56 Strategy in context 245



actually gets implemented – the enacted or realised strategy – is often very different from what was espoused or intended, for many reasons.53 These include: the impact of the biases of senior managers, new leadership, a chance opportunity that caught everyone’s imagination, bad luck, ill-thought-through investments, shifts in govern-ment policy, the arrival of new entrants or the impact of some aggrieved customer or supplier. Equally, what we imagine the future to hold will shape our decisions and actions in the present. As Prigogine said, the future contributes to the present through how we anticipate it.54 The past, in our constant re-interpreting of it, also continually reshapes the present. As we reinterpret the past or reimagine the future, we are likely to change what we do.

Organisations often adapt incrementally to such influences, and it is important to pay attention to what strategy is enacted in practice and how this changes over time. In this way, the emerging direction can be reviewed and potentially redirected if the enacted strategy has wandered too far off course.



In conclusion



Developing strategy in a complex world presents a good example of the dilemmas of planning or designing anything. On the one hand, we need to decide on the direction an organisation is heading in order to plan resource allocation and direct activities. On the other hand, if we are not flexible and do not notice and adapt to what is happening, we run the risk of either missing opportunities, or trampling on innovative or effective activities that we have stumbled across. Equally, flexibility is costly and becoming too flexible can make it hard for staff to prioritise. We may end up with an expensive mud-dle. The appropriate middle ground between clarity and adaptation will depend in part on the nature of the market and in part on the strength of the organisation to carve its own path.55

A complexity perspective on strategy places attention on the value of exploring the dynamics of the landscape in which the strategy is to be implemented. It exhorts us to pay attention to history as well as to the emerging future and to work systemically – to uncover what has stabilised, where there are leverage points and where ‘new shoots’ may be emerging; and to remain alert and attuned. The future will emerge in ways that are hard to imagine. Adapting to and exploiting changing circumstances can offer as much if not more advantage as will constantly refining our analysis of the present.

The art of systemic change



Systemic change is not always achieved by ‘acting’ systemically; evaluate when and how to

strengthen ‘the system’, when and how to disrupt it.



In this section, I focus on change. I have in mind organisational change, and the sort of change that takes place at the level of communities – place-based, social change.

In an organisational setting, this may focus on the development of a more innovative or customer-focused culture or aim to improve happiness or teamwork; in community settings, it could centre on improving well-being or prosperity.

This is a vast subject, and in this short piece I am drawing on my own experience of working in the field of change, informed by ‘Daoist-flavoured’ complexity.

The term systems change pervades the ether these days, although it is probably safer to talk about systemic change as it removes the lure of thinking that ‘a system’ – some-thing clear and boundaried – necessarily exists [13].

To speak of systemic or holistic change implies that the aim is to create change in all or most of the interwoven aspects of what is there, rather than merely affect one partic-ular aspect. Systemic change is expected to be more sustainable and resilient than if only parts or aspects are changed.



Holistic diagnosis but more focused interventions?



But if we want to create systemic change, does that necessarily mean we should aim to work with the whole?

It is certainly the case that, when planning change interventions in an organisation or community, a holistic approach to the diagnostic phase is most likely to reveal the fea-tures and patterns of what is there, paying attention to history, culture and context. This is discussed in ‘Simplicity on the other side of complexity’ [55] and ‘Strategy in context’ [56].

But when it comes to building on this diagnosis and moving into action, it is by no means self-evident that trying to work with the whole is the best option. It may be more effective to identify leverage points and focus on those, as Donella Meadows suggested.56 Or perhaps we should aim to create the conditions in which people can feel empowered to take their own initiative and let ‘one hundred flowers bloom’, as discussed in [61]?

250 VII (c) It all Depends



Strengthen or disrupt?



There is another question to consider too: Should we aim to support and strengthen positive aspects of the status quo? Or are there times when we should go all out to disrupt and destabilise power structures, or other obstacles to change?57

How to strengthen?



Participation and consensus building are often seen as the route to strengthening those aspects of the status quo we want to revitalise or develop. This is often approached through a comprehensive stakeholder engagement to define goals and create plans. Sometimes, however, it may be more effective to operate with less fanfare, in a less overt fashion – perhaps bringing people together from different stakeholder groups more informally – to share learning, develop new relationships and feel inspired to go away and experiment. Evidence that such less-coordinated processes are starting to gain traction, may arise when thought leaders and those with power and influence start to take an interest.

Sometimes, too, strengthening is less about focusing on the status quo and more about nurturing and protecting any emerging ‘new shoots’ of change. In effect, we are trying to grow something new alongside the old in the hopes that the new will supersede it.

We can also aim to find critical moments or opportunities where change can be trig-gered. Such moments may arise through an unexpected failure or unintended success, a change of leadership, a new entrant into the market, or a change in the law. Perhaps our focus should be on spotting opportunities and ‘seizing the moment’?

How to disrupt?



There are also occasions when the task is less to preserve and develop what we have, and more to destabilise and disrupt aspects that are blocking change. Being measured or seeking consensus can be ineffective when trying to shake up very locked-in situa-tions or effect a radical redistribution of power.

Change can be catalysed when people resist and refuse to be defeated by prevailing norms. They ‘stand against the crowd’ and speak ‘truth to power’. Sometimes the ne-cessity for a radical rethink is triggered by consumers or citizens deciding they have had enough; they force change through collective buying choices, boycotts or protests.

Some brave journalists and activists seek to expose powerful cabals or corruption and bring attention to ‘bad practice’ or discriminatory processes, as discussed in [71]. The same can happen – or not happen – in organisations. How much totally worthless ac-tivity goes on because nobody wants to stand up and say that something is pointless or ineffective? David Graeber in Bullshit Jobs: a Theory, committed a whole book to this topic.58 However, this is hard to do if you fear isolation, persecution, or loss of liveli-hood.

57 The art of systemic change 251



So, we should not shy away from the role of disruption and challenge and imagine that creating systemic change is always about enabling, connecting and strengthening.



Agonism: the value of productive arguing



I want to say a bit more about participation and collective decision-making. I some-times wonder whether our desire to ensure that we are seen as respectful and fair, can actually hinder progress. We may fear that if we take the lead, or say too much, or display our particular talents or knowledge, we appear overly dominant. But sure-ly, effective participation requires ‘productive disagreement’, which Chantal Mouffe calls agonism [70]? Indeed, if too much emphasis is placed on harmony, some may be tempted to subvert change through inaction and silence. Equally, discussions may go on forever and, in the desire for consensus, it can become hard to reach a decision. Or others, who have a ‘bee in their bonnet’, or a clear view of what is needed, may start to work ‘under the wire’. Deviance may not seem desirable, and yet there are times when those mavericks who break the rules are actually the ones who create movement.

Standing up for something, speaking out and being seen, can often take much cour-age. But evolutionary theory emphasises that change, and adaptation often start with events that destabilise the status quo; change is generally not a tidy process.



Conclusion



Perhaps the core message from this short foray into the topic of creating systemic change is that it is paradoxical. Whatever you say, there is some truth in its opposite. Systemic change is not always achieved by working systemically. Aiming to build con-sensus in a participative fashion has its downsides as well as its positives. Nonconfor-mance, conflict, disruption all have their place; it is not just about being ‘good’. And however well-conceived the plans and methods, things inevitably will not happen the way we imagined or intended; it all depends. When dealing with change in a complex world, there are no easy answers. What might work best is contingent on circumstanc-es. The current situation can be brought to light through a diagnostic phase, but we have to remain alert to the inevitable shifts in context over time.

But this does not mean we should give up; it means we should engage very specifically with each situation, consider what is needed, try things out and be prepared to modify direction as we go [27]. And we should beware of anyone who thinks they have a meth-od that holds true in every situation!

The sagacity of leadership in complexity



Leadership in a complex world requires high levels of wisdom and skills, plus teamwork.



Complex and sophisticated competencies



Those in positions of leadership in a complex, uncertain and fast-changing world ide-ally need the highest levels of cognitive skill, coupled with superb emotional intelli-gence and sophisticated skills of relationship-building.

Embracing complexity requires a willingness to engage with uncertainty, ambiguity and paradox. It is enhanced by an ability to contemplate the big picture, and yet, at the same time, dive into the details and particularities at the sharp end. It calls on cogni-tion, instinct and imagination in equal measure. In the main, solutions will not be sur-faced by analytical means alone.

This can seem to require – in the language of Rooke and Torbert in Seven Transforma-tions of Leadership – that we become Alchemists, or at least Sages.59 But how many of us achieve this level of wisdom, intelligence, emotional maturity, skill, foresight and humility?

Mastery hears its own heartbeat and the heartbeat of others simultaneously.

Camaren Peter60



So, what to do? If I am in a position of authority in an organisation, I need to take note of this required breadth of competencies and practices, but I cannot expect to be gifted in them all. If I am worried about my own emotional intelligence, then it will be important to work with people I trust to take the temperature of the room and help to engender good communication and collaboration. If I feel unskilled at conceptual thinking, or in-expert at finding creative solutions, then I must find people who are. To embrace the complex world effectively requires, at the very least, working closely with a diverse team to cover all bases, and often suggests the need for processes of shared leadership.

But we are at our best when we are ourselves. Any of us required to step up and lead are most effective when embracing our own uniqueness, at the same time as putting in place ways to deal with those parts of the process at which we are less adept. As Aris-totle said, “knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom”.



254 VII (c) It all Depends



Dealing with power and dominance



Embracing complexity, though, is not the only game being played. If we look around us, those in positions of power are often selected due to their ability to convey certainty in a vision or process, and by so doing, make people feel protected and secure. It can sometimes seem that adopting a stance of certainty is rewarded above all else, even if the future shows it was unfounded.

Seek clarity not certainty. Julian Baggini61



In addition, global commercial organisations have an inbuilt requirement to focus on profit and shareholder value – and the stock market drives a short timescale on these. Leaders – business leaders and politicians – are not in general rewarded for grappling with the long-term future of the planet or striving to reach their outlying and less valu-able customers or citizens. They are also, of course, not applauded for maintaining a healthy balance amongst their fellow firms or ensuring the political ecology remains vi-brant and democratic. They are there to grow, to dominate their markets and put their opponents out of action [68]. Indeed, ‘killing off’ the opposition is seen as an entirely legitimate, indeed laudable, strategy in the name of competitive advantage. Leaders of industry, and perhaps also leaders in politics, may feel under pressure to ‘leave their values at the door’ in order to do what is necessary to win [70].

In order to be effective, leaders have to engage with the reality of powerful others – others who may have very different motivations to their own – and be prepared to influence, or even out-manoeuvre, those with other values and different goals. It can be important to accept and consciously address the political nature of the ‘stage’; oth-erwise, it is possible, for example, do a great job of creating a fabulously effective, cre-ative and agile team, only to have it shut down by a senior manager who either does not understand what had been achieved, or realises that it does not suit his purpose.

How to be effective in handling power and politics needs careful consideration: how to widen your spheres of influence; how to imagine ‘walking in the shoes of others’ so you can plan how to approach them; how to become alert to the levers of power and influence that you do have available, and thus increase your agency? These are import-ant questions.



Grab the simplicity on the other side of complexity, and yet keep

an eye out for newness



It is also a relief to recognise that, on a day-to-day basis, it is not necessary to continu-ally splash about frenziedly in the sea of complexity. Partly, this ‘sea’ is often composed of relatively stable patterns and so is relatively straightforward, much of the time, to characterise. Partly, whilst the appraisal of complex situations requires grappling with a wide and messy picture, clear strategies and actions can be developed that ‘hold’,

58 The sagacity of leadership in complexity 255



at least for the short term [56]. So, the task of the leader, once the appraisal stage is completed for now, and a way forward has been decided, is to allocate roles and actions and give people space to undertake them, whilst ensuring that review process-es and opportunities for discussing unexpected obstacles or opportunities are also established.

It is of equal importance to establish ways to spot changes, opportunities and threats and ensure processes are in place to then address their implications. How, for example, can the collective intelligence of the ‘hive’ be harnessed to see early signs of changes in the wider context? The Daoists emphasise above all else the importance of the wise leader’s ability to spot change ‘at the beginning of the beginning’; they regard this as proffering great advantage [27].



Leadership as a social process



I have so far focused on the pressures that the complex world places on those who are in formal positions of leadership. But, in many ways leadership, like ‘organisation’, emerges. How decisions are actually made is a social process that is impacted but not determined by those in formal leadership roles. As Sharon Varney explains, leadership is “co-created by mutual recognition” and “emerges from the interactions of organisa-tional actors in social networks and social movements”.62 It can be thought of as a ‘pat-terning’ that is impacted by, but may also cut across, formal and legitimate authority.63

Like water, the leader is yielding. John Heider64



Some approaches to leadership take the route of abolishing permanent roles alto-gether; leadership responsibility is rotated, and leadership is participative. However, coping with too little structure can end up being time-consuming and, particularly if consensus is the aim, can result in decisions that are ‘beige’ and safe. Equally, highly participative processes can lend themselves to being ‘worked’ by those who are adept at the politics of organisations, and who are able to influence and corral support be-hind the scenes, as discussed in [57]. The best level of structuring will be contingent on purpose and context. It is important to embed the practice of paying attention to the way leadership is emerging and ask whether what is emerging is effective.65



Be bold but pragmatic



Recognising that the world is complex and oftentimes fast changing can cause us to grind to a halt. We prefer to wait for certainty before acting. Sometimes, though, hav-ing assessed the situation as clearly as possible and having reached tentative conclu-sions, the best approach is to act with confidence. Seizing the moment is a key part of success. At the same time, it is important to stay in tune with what then starts to unfold, so that we can adapt if things do not evolve as hoped [56].

256 VII (c) It all Depends



This shift in worldview requires more than recognising the messiness of the world and ‘coping’ with it or aiming to ‘manage’ it. Complexity is the source of creativity, adapt-ability and innovation. Embracing complexity contains an invitation to become ener-gised, stimulated, thrilled even, by the opportunities opened up by this shift in view.



In conclusion



Zoe Arden pointed me to Leadership for a Sustainable Future.66 In this report, she and her colleagues define leadership as:

A dynamic social process that shapes behaviour and culture, requires a meaningful

purpose, and is embedded in and shaped by context.



I think this sums it up nicely. This definition fits neatly with a process complexity worl-dview [10]. Leadership is a process not just a style or something associated with one person; and as a process it will always be changing and adapting. It is contextual – it will both be shaped by context but also needs to respond to context. And leadership shapes and is shaped by purpose. For purpose to be meaningful, it has to have what Daoists call consummate integrity [23] – a sense of wholeness that ‘makes sense’. Purpose, too, builds on intention, but is also affected by the values that determine how those inten-tions are enacted. In other words, it encompasses both where you are trying to head and how you are going to get there. As Daoists point out, in leadership, as in life, the path is made by walking [15], and the steps you take are influenced by where you want to get to – even if you never arrive, or you change your mind along the way.

Organisation: the shape of things to come67



A complex and processual perspective on organisational design, and why, in an

ever-more-complex and connected world, we should think in terms of organisational

ecologies.



Individual organisations, power and process



Ideally, the choice of organisational form or structure should enable the tasks organi-sations perform to be achieved in a way that fits the dynamics of their market. Often

though, the selection of form is driven by the mindsets of those in charge. If senior managers believe that the best approach is to mimic the workings of a machine, then bureaucratic, hierarchical structures may be established, seeking standardisation, clarity and efficiency. By contrast, if the prevailing belief is that an ability to adapt to changing external circumstances is the key to success, then a decentralised design may result. Henry Mintzberg asked whether designs are led by fashion or fit.68 Indeed, as these approaches go in and out of fashion, organisations sometimes flip and flop be-tween centralisation and decentralisation, leaving traces of the former behind.

If organisations do not properly address the polarity between control and flexibility, the resulting structure may become very complicated. The tension between a pull to centralise against a pull to localise is dealt with by adding more and more tweaks and processes on top of the existing ones. This can make it impossibly hard to get anything done. I was involved with one such organisation and it finally dawned on me that the reason I was there was to legitimise the muddle, to suggest to employees that ‘complex-ity’ meant that muddle was inevitable. But I disagree. We cannot escape the complex-ity of the environment, but we can aim to design organisations that have a degree of consistency. We should not leave it to employees to navigate the ambiguities emerging from the unresolved tension between two paradigms. I remember one employee tell-ing me that it took her two years to work out where power really lies before she could get anything done!

It is a challenge, though, to design organisations that are effective, resolve conflicting priorities (such as between cost and customer focus) and are poised to respond to an unknown emerging future. Furthermore, trying to change organisational structures is not helped by the fact that any proposed change almost inevitably leads to shifts in power at the senior level. It is interesting that the topic of organisational design – something that used to be taught in business schools and was a key specialism offered by management consultancies – seems to have almost disappeared from view. And yet, 258 VII (c) It all Depends



matching the organisation’s form to its purpose, task and market has not lost its im-portance. If this results in a muddle or mismatch, it hinders effectiveness. When staff spend more time talking about the inner world of the organisation rather than turning their attention to the outer world of the market, there is cause for concern.

A processual view of organisations



Ideally the structure of organisations should follow and not dictate the flow within key ‘business processes’, the paths through which products and services move from incep-tion to the market. This epitomises a process orientation towards organisations.69 I am not advocating there should be an exhaustive analysis resulting in detailed and com-plicated flowcharts of pipelines and pathways; but I am suggesting that evaluating the effectiveness of decision-making and communication having identified those core pro-cesses, and aiming to preference and streamline their operation, is worthy of consid-eration. Otherwise, if it is unclear which processes are core, the ‘tail may wag the dog’.

There are others who adopt such a processual view of organisations, for example Ha-ridimos Tsoukas and Robert Chia.70 They see the purpose of organisational design as streamlining and corralling activities in order to achieve desired outcomes. They say: “Organization is the attempt to order the intrinsic flux of human action and channel it towards certain ends.” 71

But they also make the point that what organisations become is always a dance between what is intended and how people respond. They emphasise the co-evolving, emergent nature of organisation, and see organisation as “a pattern that is constituted, shaped and emerging from change”.72 Whatever is designed or intended, what constitutes the actuality of organisation depends on what people do with that design – how they shift, ignore, or work round it – or indeed decide to conform to it. James March suggests that because people are “intelligently attentive to their environments and jobs” they will naturally find ways to make it work and adapt how they do things.73 His view is that what pragmatically constitutes the organisation – what actually emerges – is a com-plex weaving between the constraints imposed by structure and process, and what people actually need to do to get things done.

This makes a lot of sense; but, of course, another force is also in play, and that is power. The desire to hold on to power can work against the pragmatic desire of the ‘doers’ to adapt. Power plays can cause an organisation to have certain immovable structural blocks around which the ‘water of activity’ must flow.

In summary



Organisational reality will never accord with what was designed and intended, but if the design is aligned as much as possible with task and environment, and if its form makes sense to people, it can aid rather than obstruct. In particular, it is important to agree in principle whether the organisation needs to move closer to the market and enable flexibility at the sharp end; or whether it is best served by a more centralised

59 Organisation: the shape of things to come 259



and often siloed approach. I think of the stories people have shared of the tensions caused when sales processes are local, stock management is regional, and manufactur-ing strategy is global. Local teams report that flexible decision-making at the sharp end is hampered by the constraints these differing centralised siloed structures impose. Confusion in levels of decision-making impedes fast and adaptive decision-making and the ability to balance many factors; such confusion can hamper achievement of the primary goal – to deliver goods and services efficiently to customers.

But organisations need to say alive and adaptive. It is helpful to undertake a regular re-view of the reality of organisational life (rather than the organisation design as set out on paper). In part, this helps to surface particularly inimical, power-preserving block-ages, and identify unnecessary ‘complicatednesses’. A review can also explore whether there is need for a new approach in response to any shifts in the environment or chang-es to working practices.



Ecologies of organisations



Thus far, I have discussed individual organisations and I now want to consider organi-sations as forming ecologies.

The first formulation of a theory of organisational ecology was undertaken by Michael Hannan and John Freeman in 1977.74 This ecological perspective is relevant as we con-sider how the world of work is changing. Remote working – enabled by increased IT connectivity, flexibility in working hours, outsourcing specialist services and increased automation – is changing the game. The nature of interactions and alliances between organisations – their relative size and the way responsibilities and specialisms are di-vided up across organisations – is changing too.

The demise of the middle-sized?



Organisations with global reach are able to lock-in their dominance as they have the weight – both economic and political – to quash or purchase any aspiring new rivals.75 Since the trend towards the deregulation of markets in the late 1980s, coupled with the opportunities afforded by the internet, it would appear that there has been a rise in the numbers of mega-organisations and a reduction in the numbers of the mid-dle-sized. My observation is that the ecology of organisations consists, increasingly, of giant ‘whales’ surrounded by myriads of tiny ‘minnows’.76 The tuna and cod of the or-ganisational world are becoming endangered! Minnows can provide specialisms such as leading-edge and risky research, specialised consultancy, clever IT-driven solutions to logistics and so on. A different sort of minnow – an independent clothes designer, a restaurant with a novel theme, a dance studio – can create or exploit a local niche but can find it hard to weather variations in demand, and struggle to grow to become mid-dle-sized. Mega-organisations are able to absorb or kill off any emerging new players. This loss of ‘size balance’ is of concern, as it impacts the resilience of ecologies, both natural and organisational; this is discussed further in [64].

260 VII (c) It all Depends



Meanwhile, the world is increasingly in the hands of powerful, internet-driven organ-isations that provide communications and social media, deliver almost every product at the click of a button, and leave little room for other enterprises to emerge. Such mega-organisations have more power than do governments to shape the global future and are very hard to regulate [71].

Ecological thinking and governance



Max French and colleagues, in Harnessing Complexity for Better Outcomes in Public and Non-profit Services, consider the public service system as an ecology of organisations, where their impact is “dispersed across the relationships amongst them”.77 Working with an ecological focus – establishing processes to determine how organisations in-teract, designing methods to agree how to share resources and power and work adap-tively – would allow societies to deploy resources more effectively and achieve the collective outcomes required to serve the public needs. The same thinking has rele-vance in the corporate world too and would be useful in considering issues of global governance in the face of the rising polycrisis, given the power of mega-corporations to dominate the future, as discussed in [71]. Which is not to say it would be welcomed, easy to implement or popular!



VII (d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other





60


Paradox, polar opposites and the middle ground



When starting to reach a conclusion, explore what truth lies hidden in its opposite. By danc-

ing with paradox, fresh insights may emerge.



I am struck by how easy it can be, in conversation, to drop into generalisations and absolutes. Statements such as: ‘young people are fearful these days’, ‘no one really

changes’ or ‘people are more selfish than they used to be’. Such maxims can greatly influence what we believe needs to happen and how we think it can be achieved [65]. Maxims provide the comfort of a sort of certainty but may blinker us to engaging with their opposites. For example, if we think people need to be controlled, then we will fo-cus on creating rules. If we think individual freedom is the most important thing, then we will defend a system that imposes few constraints on that freedom.

If we allow that things may be complex, nuanced and situational, then are there ways to burrow underneath our sometimes unconscious ‘conventional wisdom’, and support us to think more broadly?

Whatever you think, think the opposite. Sharon Varney78



One approach: When you find yourself quoting some absolutist wisdom, ask what truth or value there might be in its ‘polar opposite’. It is useful to be specific. If you feel that ‘no one really changes’ then can you think of times when you, or others, did change? Trying on the opposites of any statements you or others make can help develop a more nuanced perspective and trigger a wider inquiry.

D. H. Lawrence … was prepared to allow contradictory thoughts to coexist, to push ev-

ery thought to its extremity in order to try it out and then think its opposite.79



For example, I was taken aback when I heard someone say, with great conviction, that everyone wants to be happy. It really got me thinking. How much do I value happiness? Do I think happiness is either achievable or laudable? What is the downside of focusing on happiness, as opposed to other goals such as ‘living a meaningful life’ or ‘fulfilling my potential’? For what would I like to be remembered?

Complexity theory, as well as pointing to the particularity of different situations, indi-cates that there are no easy answers, but many paradoxes [18]. Too much control and we lose adaptability and suppress innovation; too little control and we risk a muddle where no one knows what to do. Paradoxes such as these are centre stage in complex-ity thinking: freedom yet responsibility, control yet adaptability, standardisation yet response to particular circumstances, short-term versus long-term. What works here 264 VII (d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other



may not work there. Sometimes it is good to go with the flow, sometimes it is better to stand against it. Working in this middle ground, maybe working out where to start in this situation; these are the sort of judgements that the complex world demands.

The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at

the same time and still retain the ability to function. F. Scott Fitzgerald



Sometimes working with paradox requires discernment as to where to land on the continuum between opposites – the right shade of beige, the right compromise. But sometimes, it requires explicitly grappling with that paradox, and in so doing, allowing new solutions and understandings to emerge; these solutions may be radical and novel and ‘transcend’ what was there before.80



A third runway

Some years ago, I was party to a conversation about building a third runway at Heath-

row in London. The economic argument was for it; the environmental argument was

against it. And in general, in such situations, the economic argument wins. However,

the expert I was talking to pointed out to me that even if the environmental lobby won

and there was no third runway, the same amount of traffic would arrive in the region

and would merely arrive in Paris or Amsterdam. But, so he suggested, if we used the

opportunity of a new runway to tighten up on standards of pollution and install an ex-

emplary air traffic control system to minimise circling whilst waiting to land, we could

kickstart a step change in the industry and by so doing help to reduce carbon emissions

and pollution elsewhere. This struck me as an example of working creatively with what

can feel like irresolvable polar opposites (the needs of the economy versus the needs

of the environment) and coming up with a ‘third way’ (as opposed to a third runway … ).



Paradoxical, context-sensitive problems are the stuff of the complex world. The com-plex social and natural world – of diversity, openness and reflexive relationships – does not reduce down to a simple form where there are unequivocal solutions. When work-ing in complex situations, there is a need to tussle with opposites and ‘home in’ on solu-tions that are often contextual and particular to circumstances.

Irresolvables define where metaphysical opposites differ from each other, and [res-

olution] requires more than theory. It requires learning, participation, integration

and negotiation – strategies which engage directly with the contextual specifici-

ties and can possibly lead to resolution under certain context-specific conditions.

Camaren Peter81



Compromise, transcend or work in the middle ground?



There are various approaches to handling paradox, some more successful than others.

Compromise: The first is to aim for compromise. But if we are not careful, this may lead to the worst of both worlds. This approach seems to be adopted quite frequently in

60 Paradox, polar opposites and the middle ground 265



organisations, where processes are layered upon processes with the aim to compensate for the limitations of one by adding another on top [59]. This can lead to a very compli-cated muddle, in which it becomes really difficult to work out how to get things done.

Another kind of compromise ends up with what I call ‘the beige solution’. It builds on a story of a community group who were trying to agree on the colour of a new carpet. The only colour they could agree on was beige. In other words, compromise can lead to the lowest common denominator.

Transcend: The second is to adopt an intuitive, creative way to work explicitly with po-lar opposites with the aim of creating a ‘third way’ that transcends the initial polarities. The approach is to hold in mind the relevant polar opposites and allow new solutions to surface; Barry Johnson, in Polarity Management, provides a useful source of methods.82

Work in the middle ground: Thirdly, sometimes the way forward can be more prag-matic – where there is a need to find a balance between, say, clarity and flexibility, or local and global. This is ‘working in the middle ground’. Approaches are likely to be con-textual and particular to circumstances.

For example, imagine you are managing a group of hospitals, all based in different parts of the country, with very different demographies and needs. Is there a way to define the principles and outcomes that are required at the same time as allowing a degree of flexibility for each hospital to engage with the institutions in its own community and make the best of the particular local resources to respond to particular local needs? This is not a compromise – rather it leads to an approach which sorts out (a) what needs tight global control; (b) what aspects are best served by clarifying principles within which a more adaptive and contextual response can be taken; and (c) what is most ef-fectively managed and designed at local level.

Working in the middle ground, does not mean aiming for the half-way point; it re-quires working out, in this space between such polar opposites as control and flexibil-ity, where the most effective approach lies. This more flexible way of working is often well served by creating forums whereby practitioners from, say, different hospitals, can come together to share practices and learning. In this way a degree of consistency emerges through sharing practice, rather than through imposition from above.



And so …



In general, the goal is not to be satisfied with compromise , nor end up ‘going beige’. The real gold is uncovered when finding creative ways of transcending polar opposites and finding new solutions or perspectives that ‘go beyond’.

Let one hundred flowers bloom83



Sometimes, when things are impossibly locked-in, random acts are what is needed.



One of the ideas that emerged from the work of those researchers and journalists exploring the way oppressive regimes crumble was that ‘letting a hundred flowers bloom’ was often what catalysed their downfall [70]. However, allowing a free for all would seem to sit in contradiction to the assertion that clear intentions and shared values are vital drivers of change. Are there times when ‘letting things emerge’ is just what is needed to break out of rigid and hierarchical structures?

Vaclav Havel, in The Power of the Powerless, which became a manifesto for dissenters in Czechoslovakia, Poland and other communist regimes, reported that in the end people just felt compelled to ‘be themselves’ – to play their own music, dress how they wanted and embrace their uniqueness.84 He explained this was a pre-political stage, with no leadership or coordination or collective intent, and, due to that, it was very hard for the regime to oppose. A regime cannot arrest everyone.

The multiple consists of noise, but within the noise are heartbeats, rhythms, move-

ments – sustained or periodic – a thousand drums in the noise. Camaren Peter85

A colleague recounted the story of a meeting convened to discuss ways of tackling global warming. Apparently, participants were bemoaning the huge number of unco-ordinated and sometimes overlapping initiatives popping up from all sorts of differ-ent spaces. Some felt this was a waste of effort, but one had this to say: “We’re doing something unprecedented, in every corner of society and industry. There will need to be many initiatives. The number [of initiatives] will be too much for any one person to stay on top of. That’s probably a sign of success.”86

So, which route to take and how to decide? Getting out of locked-in, rigid situations, where power is held in the hands of the few, might benefit from ‘random acts of activ-ism’. By contrast, when a community is trying to become established, agreeing shared intentions and ways of working may be vital. The best approach is contingent on the prevailing conditions – whether there is rigidity, or chaos, or something in between [14]. There are times when setting the conditions for experiment, entrepreneurism and self-expression is more important than corralling it all into a meaningful direction.

One thought to wrestle with: Engaging with the complexity of the world also has some-thing to offer those who are intent on attack and destruction – rogue regimes and ter-rorist organisations. If the plan is to bring down a society from the outside, then ‘light-ing one hundred fires’ is an effective way to work. You can be opportunistic in offering military support to weaker regimes or finding weaknesses in cyber security. Fake news and taking opportunities to discredit others work well too.

268 VII (d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other



Which takes me to this: Values are probably the most vital factor to hold on to when acting in the complex, interconnected, emergent, paradoxical world in which we live. If the future is co-created through the path we walk, we need to pay attention to the quality of each step.





62


Abandon hope all ye who enter here?



In a complex world, there is always hope and yet hope can get in the way of living the life

we have.



Of all the topics I have researched and pondered, inquiring as to whether or not hope is a ‘good thing’ has provoked the greatest divergence of views.

I also notice that this inquiry into hope exemplifies how I tend to explore paradoxical, complex questions. I seem to carry the question – in this case as to whether or not hope is useful – around with me into all situations. I often find that odd snippets of informa-tion surface – on the radio, in the newspaper, when looking into something else. I get into conversations about it, and I argue with myself. Through allowing this diverse ma-terial to ferment in my brain, I seem to arrive at an understanding that is more subtle, nuanced and contextual than when I started.

This is how the inquiry unfolded.



Is hoping ‘good’ or ‘bad’?



If things are difficult, do people feel better if they keep alive the hope that things will improve? Or could that breed discontent and prevent them from making the best of to-day? Do they see today merely as a stepping-stone or waiting game until their hoped-for future arrives?

People are different and adopt their own ways to handle hope and disappointment. But it makes me wonder, given we can never really know what the future will bring, and cannot change the past that brought us to where we are, would not embracing today be the most fruitful? Or, as someone said to me, perhaps we should aim just to ‘keep a little bit of hope for our cherished dreams, but only peek at it once in a while’.

Think about the hope for love: Philip Larkin writes about the desire that is encapsu-lated in love songs and asks whether this romantic vision help when ‘life and love fall short’? 87 Might it not amplify any sense of failure or disappointment?

The glare of that much-mentioned brilliance, love,

Broke out, to show

Its bright incipience sailing above,

Still promising to solve, and satisfy,

And set unchangeably in order. So

To pile them back, to cry,

Was hard, without lamely admitting how

It had not done so then and could not now. Philip Larkin88

270 VII (d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other



Consider how we long for recovery from illness: Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh writes about the value of giving hope to patients, even to those with poor expected outcomes. He says: “Hope is one of the most precious drugs doctors have at their disposal … hope is a state of mind, and states of mind are physical states of our brains, and our brains are intimately connected to our bodies.”89 Giving hope, exaggerated or otherwise, ex-tends people’s lives through helping patients to manage stress and endure treatment.

What about the hope that we will reverse global warming? One research paper shows that giving people too much hope that all will be well limits their motivation to change. What leads to action is the fear that time is running out. They conclude that emotional distress is strongly correlated with the motivation to take action; hope is not.90

Hope can drive us forwards. But what happens when our hopes are dashed – when our longed-for career never materialises, or when our plans are thwarted by catastrophes not of our making? Buddhist writer Jack Kornfield writes of the transformative power of loss of hope, of disillusionment. He says, “disillusionment … is a powerful and fiery gateway. To be disillusioned is to be stripped of our hopes, imaginings, and expecta-tions”; he explains that loss of hope can lead to a more solid base from which to move forwards. In contrast, he believes that if we merely cling to the hope that the future will turn up something better, and never fully enter into these pits of despair, these un-resolved losses and traumas may continue to haunt us.91 The paradox is that, through giving up on hope and embracing disillusionment, we may find new promise ‘on the other side’.



Hoping against hope: in a complex world, there’s always hope



Complexity thinking has an interesting contribution to make to this debate in that it speaks to the difference between probability and possibility. To give an example: The dire consequences of global heating are very likely to be disastrous beyond our wildest imaginings. But we can still legitimately cling to the possibility that there is yet a way forwards, still some collective will or brave government or leading corporation that can tip the balance. Things may look doomed but sometimes they change on the head of a pin; sometimes a number of factors come together at the same time, and some-thing seemingly impossible becomes possible. I imagine Nelson Mandela, in his twen-ty-first year of imprisonment, did not really expect to get out alive, never mind become President of a post-apartheid South Africa. But it seems that Mandela continued to live life according to his values and did not give up. Keeping alive a little bit of hope can help to endure today and attune us to any unexpected possibilities as they arise and motivate us to keep moving forwards.

Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, has this to say:

While I’m not a fan of hope as a guiding principle, because it by definition assumes that

the outcome will be good, which I know is not a given, I am completely enamoured with

the amount of possibility that’s available to us. So that’s the word that I try to embrace

when I think about what if we get it right, is how much possibility remains.92

62 Abandon hope all ye who enter here? 271



Rebecca Solnit agrees that it is the innate unpredictability of the world that is a cause for hope. She says: “It is easy to forget in retrospect how astonishing was the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 … or how marriage equality seemed like a long shot just before it became a reality in countries all over the world.” Solnit points out how unimaginable 2022 would have seemed in 1972 and how little our modern world resembles either prediction or science fiction. She reminds us that “we see no farther that the little halo that is cast by our lanterns, but we can travel all night by that light”.93

To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that

human history is a history not only of cruelty but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage,

kindness.

What we choose to emphasise in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see

only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times

and places – and there are so many – where people have behaved magnificently, this

gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a

world in a different direction. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to

wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and

to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us,

is itself a marvellous victory. Howard Zinn94

I give the last word to complexity theory, which, if it could, would say that nothing is fixed forever, and things do change. Hope springs eternal!

Seeing the world through new eyes:

some simple approaches



Pragmatic suggestions of how to ‘embrace complexity’ in organisations that do not.

The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new sights, but in looking with new

eyes. Marcel Proust



People who start to ‘get’ complexity tend to have one of two reactions. One is a sense of relief; they always thought things were that way and had for a long time ques-

tioned the orthodoxy of mainstream management methods. They feel empowered. By contrast, ‘getting’ complexity makes others feel bewildered and despondent. They ask ‘well, given I still have to adhere to the methods in my organisation which don’t allow such freedom, what am I supposed to do’?

Below are some pragmatic suggestions as to how to embrace complexity in a world that does not always want to.



Uncovering



In what ways can we uncover both what is newly emerging in the landscape and what has been overlooked – such as unexpected successes, or emerging opportunities or threats in the wider context?

Questions: Ask more questions, particularly of outward-facing staff. Do they detect a shift in mood or a change in the habits of customers? Are they picking up anything surprising or exciting? Such questions can give people the permission to share their intuitions; these intuitions can always be followed up more rigorously and, if sever-al people notice not-dissimilar issues, then confidence builds that there is a change emerging.

Micro-sharing: Add five minutes to the end of project or review meetings to ask about concerns, ideas, or share what is on the grapevine. Encourage people to discuss what isn’t working too. If people become used to this slot, they can feel that their opinions and insights are valued, and they may consequently develop a greater sense of respon-sibility for making things work. Such early warnings can usefully surface problems within projects, or spot changes within the organisation or its environment.

Network: Search out and sustain contacts with people who have a handle on the fu-ture, not just those in the mainstream. Build your own thought-leadership network.

Manage by walking about (MBWA): This is a phrase traced to Hewlett Packard in the 1970s and captures the value of informal encounters to sense into what is going on. I 274 VII (d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other



think of MBWA when waiting in the reception areas of organisations. How do reception staff engage with me and with each other? Is the area welcoming? I’m already forming opinions about the organisational culture before I have properly set foot inside.



Expect the unexpected and look at situations dynamically



Allow some leeway to experiment: Strategies finely attuned to today almost by defi-nition will not be so well attuned to tomorrow. In addition to doing ‘sensible’ things supported by market analysis, build on a few hunches and take a few risks. You may un-cover hidden niches, or even create new niches through acting into the environment.

Create long-term intentions but make detailed plans for the short term: Review of-ten and reposition ‘not going to plan’ as learning, not failure. Failure is an inability or unwillingness to adapt.

Create steering groups with diverse stakeholders: If projects or strategies are steered by people with a diverse range of perspectives – including junior staff, staff from dif-ferent departments, independents from outside or a customer or supplier – the con-versation can be much richer; it can both allow a robust discussion of what is working and what is not, and also facilitate a creative exploration of what needs to change. If a regular steering group of this nature is not practical, then convene a review meeting on a regular basis to really dig deep and take more than a superficial view as to whether things are going to plan.



Context and history matter



Aim to maintain some consistency in approach over different parts of your organisa-tion, whilst recognising that there are differences in history and context. A school or hospital in a city, for example, has different problems and opportunities to one in a ru-ral setting. How to benefit from consistency, and yet allow some freedom to adapt?

Develop good practice by sharing, not by diktat: Share learning and good practice in conferences, or convene regular get-togethers with people from different geogra-phies, or from different parts of the organisation. Rather than ‘roll out’ good practice, encourage mutual influencing through swapping stories and examples.

Mine the past: The past is a good source for understanding what works and what doesn’t. It seems to have gone out of fashion to chat with people who used to do your job or contact people who have moved on. But it is an amazingly efficient way to learn some of the pitfalls, be provided with useful contacts, and gain the perspective of those who no longer have to be careful what they say. Also, the present is built on the past, so these conversations will enrich your understanding of the current territory on which you are operating.

63 Seeing the world through new eyes: some simple approaches 275



Use existing methods, but mediated through a different mindset



As an example of being required to use an existing method, suppose you are faced with a rather mechanical performance management system. You have to submit to Human Resources a set of objectives for each member of your team and show that you have reviewed these objectives. What can you do to make this approach more ‘complexity friendly’?

You could:

• Set some shared goals: Have a discussion with the whole group about what is

needed, what feels more certain, what feels more up in the air. Out of this could

come some joint objectives, together with a list of ‘things to watch’.

• Set some aspirational goals couched in developmental language: Rather than

be tempted to make objective setting ‘safe’, is it possible to couch ‘stretch goals’

in terms of developing the person, so she is not disadvantaged if these are not

achieved?

• Review more often: Review more regularly than the official form requires,

and if possible, on review, modify or re-weight existing objectives. Use review

discussions to consider the impact of shifts in the outer world, or surface problems

with other departments, so that response can be timely.

These suggestions are not ‘rocket science’, but hopefully they do illustrate ways to work more adaptively, and in a more connected fashion, within the constraints of cur-rent management systems.



Asking questions



I really like the following story shared by a junior manager in a company that makes plastic materials. He wanted to stimulate conversations that caused people to ques-tion the status quo, without overly rocking the boat.



Working under the radar: biding your time and sticking to your values

A former student, inspired by complexity thinking, wanted to see what he could do

to get his colleagues in the organisation where he worked – a company that made

plastic – to pay more attention to environmental concerns. He managed to get

permission to set up a future-thinking team to brainstorm ways to modify existing

materials and also discuss non-plastic options. The senior management were not very

open to this, and he didn’t make much impact, although the group continued to meet.

But he kept asking questions about issues of pollution and waste whenever he got the

chance. I saw him a year later. The company had been taken over by another, one that

was much more interested in new materials. His quiet activism and determination

had got him noticed. He was promoted into a role which aligned with his values and

concerns and gave him a platform to put them into practice.

276 VII (d) It’s neither One Thing nor the Other



This next story illustrates how a head teacher changes the culture in his school through a shrewd use of questions.



Leading questions

A head teacher describes how he engenders change in his school.95 His aim is to nudge

the organisation’s values through judicious choice of questions. In so doing, he indicates

what he sees as important (reminiscent of the approach to natural governance dis-

cussed in [53]). He might ask: How do you demonstrate the value of honesty to pupils?

How do you show appreciation of unusual or expected answers? How do you show the

class you care? Paradoxically, his approach both opens up a space for dialogue through

legitimating a new language (caring, for example, now becomes an ok word); at the same

time, he shapes and constrains that space through clarifying what is deemed important.



The power of questions: Both these stories, above, really emphasise for me the power of questions. Asking questions can raise difficult issues in a way that is not too con-fronting. For example, asking ‘what are you worrying about’ can encourage people to share concerns and bad news earlier so that things can be tackled. Being curious and interested can also encourage a more relational approach that sets the ground for ask-ing for help or sharing learning. It can be a way to get into ‘why’ questions and into problem-solving. And the direction of questioning can display what is deemed import-ant and encourage and legitimate new topics for discussion.

Helping others to ‘get complexity’: Asking questions can also provide a means to en-courage others to notice the complexity of situations. For example, asking why a strat-egy did not go to plan is a very effective tool for surfacing issues of context, emergence and interdependency. Such discussions can help people to engage with the complexity of the world and start to explore new ways of working. Once you’ve seen the world as complex, it is hard to unsee it.



And so…



I hope these simple thoughts on how to embrace complexity in environments which do not immediately see its value – and would rather avoid its challenge – offer some pragmatic suggestions for practice in organisational settings.

Finally, leading in our complex world can seem a daunting, and overwhelming chal-lenge. It is impossible to control complex situations, so it is pointless to aim to do this. Similarly, you cannot predict the future. What you can do, is behave with integrity, in line with your values and beliefs, and sleep soundly knowing you did the best you could.





Section VIII




On the Global





64


Introducing on the global: world without end?



Complexity thinking applied to the global emphasises the systemic interdependencies of the

social, environmental, political and economic; seeks a middle ground between laissez-faire

and control; raises concerns over the potential for lock-in of power and growing inequality

and provides a challenge to unremitting economic growth.



My growing preoccupation is with the global. As I’ve been writing this book, we have emerged from a pandemic, the biggest thing to happen to the global economy –

not to mention its impact on global health and wellbeing – for many years. We are ex-periencing global heating, leading to desertification, rising sea levels, increasing fre-quency of extreme weather events, loss of polar ice and rising temperatures. There is mass extinction, ocean acidification, pollution and ozone depletion – all problems of the global commons. Recent and ongoing conflicts and wars show the extent to which food security and energy supply are global concerns; production, to be efficient, has tended to become more concentrated by region – and hence control of resources, in-cluding their transport, becomes both a goal and a weapon of war. Social media, with its global reach, can inform and connect, but can also manipulate, incite, disinform and embed means of surveillance. There is growing economic inequality, both within coun-tries and between countries, and seemingly ever-worsening geopolitical unrest. Con-templating all this together does not conjure up a happy picture.

These issues are complex, interpenetrating and vast. If complexity theory is good for anything, it must be able to throw some light on this global landscape and help us to think through what we need to do. Many of our urgent challenges are truly global; no country, region or people can isolate themselves from the global reach of disease or greenhouse gases, or from the impact of those gigantic, dominant global companies, or escape the will of superpowers.

Exploring these global issues not only provides a perspective in its own terms, but also serves to illustrate and bring to life principles at play in a complex world that have ap-plicability at different scales and in different contexts. These include the self-organisa-tion and self-regulation of societies, their path dependence, the dangers of lock-in and the way societal patterns are shaped through the systemic weaving of the economic, the political, the social and the environmental.

This section offers some insights and perspectives and suggests some ways forward.



280 Section VIII On the Global



In this Section



‘It’s only make-believe’ explores the way values, beliefs, and intentions shape social and economic policy. Beliefs (in individual freedom or the centrality of equality), fears (of those of different creeds or backgrounds), and attitudes (seeing nature as a re-source to consume or as something to preserve) are of fundamental importance. They shape what we view as appropriate goals and methods, and what we regard as effec-tive political or economic structures. Beliefs have immense potency; they can provide the fuel to push for change, cement in the status quo, cause us to ‘bow to our fate’, or legitimise our treatment of others ‘not like us’.

The second piece, ‘Our home, the earth’, considers what creates the wherewithal for the earth to self-regulate and find balance, and questions the viability of unfettered economic growth.

‘Run, run, run, run, runaway’ discusses the nature of runaway change and why we find the concept so hard to embrace when developing policy to address pandemics, climate change or potential environmental collapse.

‘Free markets: free for whom?’ discusses free market ideologies and how complexity thinking illustrates that minimal regulation can lead to the widening of inequality in the absence of mitigating ‘counterforces’ such as the role of the state and the role of values and intentions to mediate this tendency.

In ‘Does the economy have to be predicated on growth?’, I discuss the reasons for ‘lim-its to growth’ and reflect on alternative economics models.

The next piece, ‘On the political’, considers the reflections of various political writers who have lived through the rise and fall of dictatorial regimes. They explore, through these experiences, both how to arrest the path-dependent journey towards the dilu-tion of democratic freedoms and also how to shift away from locked-in power.

In the final piece of the book, I discuss what is being called the rising polycrisis. I con-sider the need to strengthen global governance and address what this crisis demands of us all.



Three overarching points



Before I head off into the substance of the Section, I want to examine three points in particular which are relevant to what follows:

The first focuses on the value of the unexciting-sounding middle ground – also known more enticingly as the Goldilocks zone. The second reflects on what it means to con-sider situations systemically, and the third reflects on the issue of scale. What is the necessary balance, in a global world, between working at the scale of the globe, the nation and society?

64 Introducing on the global: world without end? 281



1. Goldilocks and the middle ground



And then she went to the porridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and

that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right.

There is one difference in emphasis between the organisational and the global that is worthy of mention, and that is the way we humans have chosen to engage at these different levels. When considering how to manage organisations, the tendency is to-wards control through imposing a machine-like order, with the intention of enhancing clarity and efficiency. Section VII, Perspectives on Organisational Practice, gives many examples as to where the imposition of machine thinking at the level of the organisa-tion has unintended and unhelpful consequences.

Meanwhile, at the level of the economy, the focus has moved, since the late 1980s, in the direction of trusting that ‘natural law’ will give the freedom needed for ‘the best’ to survive – so-called laissez-faire or free market economics. In many parts of the world, by following free market thinking, the state’s role in providing services, owning and managing resources and regulating the economy has been diminished. In ‘Free mar-kets: free for whom?’ [68], I consider, amongst other things, the implications of leaving it all to the market.

It is interesting that the machine view of organisations and the free market approach to economics both have their roots in classical physics. The economists chose the phys-ics of equilibrium thermodynamics in their assumption that economic systems find bal-ance and ‘stationarity’ [8], and the management theorists were allured by the deter-ministic physics of Newton [3].

However, whether starting from too much control or too little, the desired end state is not dissimilar – freedom, but not unfettered freedom; processes of control but not overarching control.

As I have argued in Section VII, organisations often need to allow more flexibility, trust people more, and take more note of the particularities of context and history to shape management processes and structures [53].

In contrast, when considering processes that operate at the global level, such as eco-nomic processes, the starting point is often centred on too much freedom rather than too little. In that situation, I conclude, it implies we need to find ways – through reflect-ing on the purpose of the economy, exploring methods of governance and reinstating some methods of regulation – to re-introduce some forms of control.

Complexity theory does not equate with laissez-faire: A point to emphasise strongly, discussed in ‘Free markets: free for whom? ’[68], is that complexity theory does not advocate for laissez-faire and does not suggest that self-organising processes necessar-ily find balance. Rather, complexity theory shows how the big can get bigger, and the powerful more powerful. Over time, even forests end up with less diversity, and can 282 Section VIII On the Global



become more rigid and less resilient to shocks and changes around them, as Holling demonstrated [14].1 Positive feedback loops, if unfettered, can accord more power to the powerful and more wealth to the wealthy; the hope for a ‘natural’ reinstatement of balance is a hope in vain.2

The pieces in this section reflect on different aspects of the global world and, in the main, suggest that we need to consider ways to mediate the way power can concen-trate. Path dependence is at work here, so the advice is not to leave it so late that things have locked-in and thus become very hard to shift.

What do we value: Furthermore, as well as considering these more structural aspects of society, these pieces also bring into focus the importance of what we, as individuals and societies, value [68]. How do we think about the balance between personal desires and community needs, between the short-term and the long-term? What is the role of citizens in governance in order to hold governments and institutions to account? What services and responsibilities are best handled more locally, through a combination of public institutions, civil society and not-for-profits? Values and beliefs play a huge role in creating the global future [65] and exploring and mutually reflecting on values can be effective in moving towards a more inclusive and balanced future.

Not too much, not too little: I am arguing that societies, to be resilient, need to seek the ‘Goldilocks zone’ in the middle ground [60]. Too much direction will stymie, if not eradicate, the natural tendency for a community or society to be creative and able to find mutually beneficial ways to form synergies and cooperations. But too little direc-tion, or scant attention to values or rules, can allow an unstoppable co-option of power by those for whom the values of cooperation or fairness are not high on their agenda. Child and slave labour, inhumane farming practices and exploitation of workers con-tinue to happen in today’s world, when laws are either not in place or are not enforced. We need to find solutions that sit within the space between controlling everything and controlling nothing. We must ask: What kinds of regulations, laws or structures are needed? Conversely, what are the circumstances in which things are best left to sort themselves out? The solutions are always contextual – rarely are there answers that fit all circumstances.

2. Thinking systemically



Complexity theory takes a systemic perspective. Politics and the economy do not op-erate separately but are very interwoven, both in terms of ideology and identity, and in the way they function; the social, economic, political and environmental are all co-de-pendent and mutually affect each other. Despite this, certainly for the West, the focus on economic growth can trump almost anything else. If we choose between the econom-ic value of drilling anew for oil versus its impact on global heating, it invariably seems to be the case that the economic argument wins. Indeed, the environmental or social are often reframed in economic terms, such as in ‘ecosystems services’ or ‘gross national happiness’.

64 Introducing on the global: world without end? 283



By paying attention to the systemic nature of the global world, we underline the need for the interweaving of policy across all spheres and for ensuring the voice of the fu-ture is not lost in the debate. There are those in academia who are pushing for more transdisciplinary approaches to scholarship to allow for such systemic thinking and to counter the practice of delving deeper and deeper into ever-narrower specialisms.3 Creating strategic visions, setting systemic goals and intentions is also of great value, as Mariana Mazzucato emphasises [68]. These strategic visions can shape our thinking about the determinants of such outcomes; such visions are best tackled systemically, taking note of many interwoven strands.

The crises feed on each other in a sort of polycrisis—ecological, economic, political, so-

cial, civilizational—and it is escalating. Edgar Morin4



3. Scale



The third introductory point I want to make is about scale. To begin with the exam-ple of ecologies, mature ecologies, to survive, have to find a mutual balancing between species. But this does not mean that all species are of similar scale. There needs to be a balance between the large, the smaller and the tiny. Such an ecological balance can and does emerge in natural ecologies, both in the ocean and on land. However, when this balance in the population ecology is distorted – through, say, over-fishing whales – then the ecology as a whole loses resilience. What happens in this instance is that when the whale population substantially reduces, the population of krill, the tiny fish on which they feed, reduces too. This seems counterintuitive. But, apparently, the ac-tivity of whales diving deep brings up food resources from the depths for the krill to feed on, so having fewer whales does indeed result in there being fewer krill.5 Ecolo-gies require the giant, the medium and the tiny in dynamic balance – not too much, or too little, of any.

This concept of the need for balance in scale translates into the social world too. I dis-cuss this in relation to ecologies of organisations in ‘Organisation: the shape of things to come’ [59]. In similar vein, E. F. Schumacher, it is said, did not want his book to be called Small is Beautiful, because he recognised the need to select the appropriate scale for the issue.6 This ideal of working at the appropriate scale, known as subsidiarity, was adopted for a while as UK government policy in 1992. In 2010, the notion of ‘big society’ was promoted as a way to help society regenerate through giving citizens the means to look after their own communities; it continues today with devolution to cities and counties.7

Working locally to tackle locally determined, systemic goals concerning wellbeing or prosperity can be really effective and efficient. A local focus can open up ways and means for the public, private and not-for-profit sectors to work together to handle complex issues, making use of quirky local opportunities in the best possible way. But a local focus doesn’t help the design and upkeep of transport networks or energy 284 Section VIII On the Global



provision. And the issue we now face more than ever is that many of our challenges – global heating, pandemics, geopolitical unrest, economic, environmental and political migration – have to be tackled globally and collaboratively in a world not used to operating in that way.

Considering in what ways we need to think and act locally and where we need a region-al or global focus is an important factor to explore when engaging with the complex world.



Key strands



The pieces in this section, On The Global, raise many questions. I summarise below some of the strands that emerge as particularly salient:

• It is vital to dig for and bring to the surface the beliefs that underpin a particular

view of politics or economics before getting entranced by its mechanisms.

• If we are to sustain society and the environment into the future, we need economic

policies and practices that value more than profit and growth and in particular

tackle inequality.

• We have to ‘challenge early’ if iniquitous economic or political systems are not

to get locked-in and become unassailable, at which point can we only wait for

collapse?

• There is always power in the people.

• Values matter; we lose our humanity at our peril.





65


It’s only make-believe



What we believe about human nature, about the way things work underpins policy devel-

opment and the design of economic and political structures. It is vital to explore beliefs and

search for the beliefs of others when evaluating approaches to policy.

The belief that there is only one truth, and that oneself is in possession of it, is the root

of all evil in the world. Max Born



Beliefs matter. A belief of one sort or other lurks beneath almost everything we choose to do. I have elected to discuss beliefs in this Section, ‘On the Global’, be-

cause beliefs fundamentally impact political choices and shape social and economic policy.

In Section I, I discussed ontological beliefs, beliefs about ‘the way things work’. Does the world work like a and machine and so require hierarchical processes of control? Or is the world more complex and better served by social policies that are adaptive and contextual?

But, as well as these scientific worldviews, we have beliefs about the characteristics of ‘the other’. What are our views about the import of race, gender, disability, intelli-gence, religion or class? Who do we trust, who do we fear, who do we value? Who is ‘civilised’ and worthy, and who is not? Do we believe the strongest has an inalienable right to win? Do we have little sympathy for those who struggle because we think that ‘if we can do it, then anyone can’? Are we prepared to shut our minds to those who are negatively impacted by our ways of life? What value and meaning do we place on the natural world?

Some of our beliefs concern basic human nature – is Man good or evil or merely selfish and determined to win? Jean Hardy, in A Wiser Politics, explores in depth the way ideas about human nature drove foundational political and economic ideologies, and I rec-ommend her short book.8

Hardy discusses two of the key thinkers who shaped political ideologies: Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Hobbes expressed the view that human nature is essentially competitive and acquisitive.

Men love themselves best, have insatiable desires and want more and more and are

never satisfied. Hobbes9



In contrast, Rousseau said that “everything is good when it leaves the hands of the Cre-ator; it degenerates in the hands of man”.10

But is there any evidence to support the views of either Hobbes or Rousseau? I consid-er this question, from many angles, below.

286 Section VIII On the Global



Is Man ‘good’ or ‘evil’: some evidence

Anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrove, in The Dawn of Ev-

erything, argue that there is little anthropological evidence to suggest that Man’s pri-

mordial state was either of innocence or of ‘war of all against all’.11 They make the point

that Hobbes and Rousseau were hazarding opinions, as opposed to developing views

based on evidence.

Socio-biologists David Sloan Wilson12 and Edward O. Wilson13 view Man’s nature

through the lens of evolutionary biology. They suggest that, for packs of men to hunt

down animals more powerful than themselves, they needed to cooperate, to work as

a team. Yet they also recognise that Man, from earliest times, had the capacity to kill

‘the other’ – other tribes and groups who might take over their hunting grounds. Their

conclusion is that Man seems able both to cooperate with and take care of members of

his own tribe but also, with impunity, to kill, rape and pillage those who are different,

those whom he fears, or who have what he wants. In similar vein, Jane Goodall, in her

research on chimpanzees, was disappointed to find chimpanzees could show great ten-

derness and compassion for their tribe but would attack tribes who might impinge on

their territory in the most brutal manner, even if they were relatives.14

Looking at the field of psychology, Donald Winnicott explains that babies are born self-

ish and omnipotent and then, if all goes well with their development, they mature into

children and young people who can balance this selfish desire with the desire to think

of others. We are born selfish but have the capacity to cultivate our other-centredness

along the way. 15



I found this brief search for evidence about human nature – and there was more I hav-en’t shared – very illuminating. It suggests, perhaps not surprisingly, that Man can be both ‘good’ and ‘bad’, both compassionate and selfish. But we have some agency in this. If we also take into account the plasticity of the brain and the way it can change as we make different decisions and adopt new behaviours [44], it would appear that we have some choice as to whether we cultivate our best or worst traits [25]. What each of us becomes is path-dependent – a function of personal decision-making, although also shaped by what happens along the way, and shaped by the beliefs of our peer groups and culture.



Why does this matter? Beliefs shape ideology, policy and practice



As Hardy emphasised, what we believe about human nature has a strong impact on our chosen ideologies, and these in turn affect our views on policy. For example, if a politi-cian has to balance spending on health and education against spending on defence, po-lice and prisons, how do her beliefs about human goodness sway her decisions? Simi-larly, fear or distrust of ‘the other’ – fearing they are ‘bad’ – is likely to amplify concerns over immigration or the right to protest. On the other hand, believing too much in the good in others might allow someone to overly trust leaders when they are, in actuality, playing by different rules; a civil servant, for example, may develop regulatory policies that unrealistically rely on ‘gentlemen’s agreements’ to act fairly and openly.

65 It’s only make-believe 287



Justifications for adopting free market ideologies



As well as the (questionable) belief that it is in the nature of things to find balance, discussed in [68], there are further assumptions and assertions that build the case for free markets. Hobbes, for example, viewed society as essentially a series of market re-lations between selfish individuals and competing institutions.16 A free market, it then follows, makes a virtue out of the inevitable self-centredness of the individual, and pro-motes competition as the only game in town.

Interestingly, Friedrich Hayek was also a strong proponent of free markets, but his be-liefs centred on our rights rather than on human nature. Hayek believed, as did Kant, that the sovereignty of the individual, the right to individual liberty and freedom, was paramount. He felt that the market was the best invention of human society as it made people free.17

Some argue that, in a free market, there is equality of opportunity if not equality of outcome.18 Although some do better than others, free markets cause the playing field to be level, so the argument goes. Others argue that equality of opportunity does not really exist. Hashi Mohammed, for example, points out that equality of opportunity is driven in part by education and ability, but that ‘getting on’ is strongly facilitated by the path-dependent process of growing up in the right milieu and associating with the right people.19

The point I am making is that the beliefs held by those who design and implement eco-nomic and political systems will strongly determine what they see as the right way to ‘do’ economics or politics.



Hidden and dangerous beliefs



Sometimes, rather prejudicial and judgemental beliefs are hidden. For example, do we view those who are struggling as mainly deserving of support with just a few shirkers who slip through the net, or do we imagine there are mainly shirkers with only a few who are deserving? Do we regard ‘the masses’ as largely capable of understanding the governance issues at stake, or do we take rather a dim view of people’s abilities to evaluate the arguments? Such beliefs often remain undiscussed or undisclosed, apart from in private. But beliefs form the starting point for our thinking and can have a huge impact on policy development.

A lot of rich people expect poor people to be stupid. Gary Stevenson20

Questioning the beliefs of those in power, those who are making the rules, is often not an easy process, in part as commonly held beliefs tend to be seen as self-evidently true and unremarkable. For example, Clive Hamilton, in Requiem for a Species, points out that a tendency to deny global warming stands on the belief that the rhetoric around climate change constitutes an envious attack on preserving comfortable lifestyles, and is hence politically motivated.21

288 Section VIII On the Global



Standing apart from the crowd with respect to our beliefs is often uncomfortable and even, in some circumstances, dangerous. Think of the Suffragettes, or conscientious objectors, those who challenged apartheid, or those who call out the loss of democrat-ic freedoms [41] [70].



Beliefs matter



History shows that speaking out, being prepared to challenge accepted beliefs and narratives, is a vital tool in creating fresh and inspirational new solutions. Beliefs play a central role in the development of societal norms and social structures. Without sur-facing and being prepared to evaluate and challenge some of these beliefs, the possi-bility for change is constrained. We don’t change the game; we merely play it better.

Complexity thinking, through the concepts of path dependence and lock-in, provides a reminder that when beliefs and ways of doing things become institutionalised, it can become hard for alternatives to be heard and gain traction. This is in part because those who benefit from established norms tend to resist change, and in part because we just tend to take for granted that there is no alternative to the status quo.

Our home, the earth



Exploring the systemic interweaving of the environmental and the social and describing

how the behaviour of a rogue species can destabilise the whole.

Ooh baby it’s a wild world. Cat Stevens

And you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone. Joni Mitchell



The earth is an interwoven system, a huge ecosystem that has been able, over mil-lennia, to find a dynamic, resilient balance. It is balanced in the sense that, whilst various aspects – ocean and air currents, temperature differentials, distribution of flora and fauna – vary, they tend not to vary too far; they are able, collectively to main-tain the earth within certain limits. The earth functions in a similar way to the human body, which, through adapting to changes in external conditions such as high or low temperatures or variations of intake of food and water, is able, within reason, to keep its temperature, salinity, heart rate and so on within bounds. This is self-regulation. It engenders resilience – staying within limits in the midst of variation in conditions, providing those variations are not too extreme. Heat or starve your body to too great an extent, and you will pass the point of no return and be no more.

We know from studying the ecology of, say, forests, that certain conditions facilitate the maintenance of such a dynamic resilient balance. These are: sufficient diversity of species, the establishment of synergistic food chains between species that are neither too fixed nor too chaotic, and an openness to the wider context [14].

The ecosystem’s balance is maintained so that the diverse members live in intricate

collaboration and competition and the complex whole of the ecology is dynamically

stable. Peter Reason22



Mature ecologies that have developed over millennia have evolved a mutual balancing. However, even in the natural world, this dynamic balancing can go awry. Self-regula-tion does not occur under all circumstances. Rabbits, say, introduced into New Zea-land, wipe out native fauna and, every few decades, go through explosive plagues of population growth. These die down as they eradicate the vegetation on which they live. But, as this causes soil erosion, many areas never recover.23

Akin to the rabbits in New Zealand, there is one species that is having huge impact on the whole global ecology and that is we Humans. We are using up resources – water, minerals, land – at a vast and accelerating rate, and in the process, creating global heat-ing. The rate of the rise of carbon emissions has slowed down a little over the last few years, but the amount of carbon in the atmosphere continues to rise.24 Carbon survives in the atmosphere for thousands of years.

290 Section VIII On the Global



[There] is a new age in the history of the Earth, which definitively began with the “great

acceleration” of the 1950s. The basis of the Anthropocene hypothesis is the concep-

tion of the Earth as a single dynamic, self-regulated complex system characterized by

physical, chemical, and biological, as well as human, components … nature and society

have become one single thing. Mauro Ceruti25



One of the sobering thoughts for us as humans is that ecological health – the ability of the planet to self-regulate – is a function of the whole system, of which our economic system is only a part. We do have the power to destabilise the whole, but we cannot control it. In the end, it is the globe that will respond systemically to all its constituent interwoven aspects – heat from the sun impacted by greenhouse gases, water, land, forests, fauna, and of course, our own behaviour. The earth will have the capacity to adapt – or not. It will have the last word, so to speak. Like any other ecological system, there can be points of no return for the earth as a whole, from which there is no easy reversal. This is a central tenet of complexity science. Complexity science explains the conditions under which self-regulation is effective – but it also emphasises that at tip-ping points, things can get irredeemably out of balance and irreversible change can take place [17].



Global tipping points

One example of a global tipping point is the way, from 2020, that cases of Covid 19 rose

exponentially in a very short space of time. Politicians were having to adjust to the fact

that if there were signs of a rise in cases, they only had days to react to try to reduce

social contact and curb the spreading. One day’s delay made a huge difference to the

rise in cases.

Global heating has the same characteristic dynamics as a pandemic, and there are sim-

ilar dynamics leading to the point at which an ocean or soil is no longer able to sustain

life, or sea ice is no longer able to reconstitute itself. Extreme weather caused by cli-

mate breakdown has led to increased deaths from intensifying heatwaves in all regions,

millions of lives and homes destroyed in droughts and floods, millions of people facing

hunger, and ‘increasingly irreversible losses’ in vital ecosystems.26



The potential for global irreversible change should not be overlooked. And, as we are seeing, our economic activity has the power to endanger global ecological self-regula-tion. If we want the earth’s ecosystem to remain in balance, we need to put the spot-light on the economy; the form of our economic processes, together with the levels of growth, need addressing if we are to avoid irreversible catastrophe.

We’re at a tipping point in the relationship we have with ourselves, with each other and

our world. A world which is so intricately connected, so interdependent, so intrinsically

linked. So delicate. The power struggles between huge organisations, economics, de-

velopment and the species we share our planet with is growing … out of control. Dara

Run, run, run, run, runaway28



Change tends to be either fast and furious; or things can seem stuck forever.

A 2023 article in Nature explains that Antarctic sea ice has “entered a new regime”.29 The very low sea ice coverage is no longer reversible but is here to stay. As they ex-plain, this has huge knock-on effects on coastal erosion, ice shelf stability and deep ocean ventilation. Thinner ice is also less effective in blocking the sun’s rays, and so what results is positive feedback between reducing sea ice coverage and increasing ocean temperatures. The whole interconnected system finds a new, more concerning dynamic and leaves the past balance behind. There has been a so-called ‘phase change’.

In similar vein, a 2024 study of ocean currents in the north Atlantic describes the shift-ing situation in much the same language. The report explains that the Atlantic Ocean circulation is nearing a “devastating tipping point” and that the expected “collapse in the system of currents that helps regulate global climate” is likely to be at such a speed that “adaptation would be impossible”. 30

Regime shifts or phase changes occur when there are radical irreversible system-ic changes. Such changes can be sudden and catastrophic. Examples are the end of apartheid or the fall of the Berlin Wall; systems persist for a long time despite internal weakening and loss of resilience, but the final collapse often takes us by surprise. Some phase changes lead to break down, like the ocean currents; others lead to runaway change, like a pandemic. There can also be a more gradual shift towards a new set of characteristics and conditions; think of a garden – gradually, as the climate warms, dif-ferent plants start to flourish, different insects find a home and over time the garden ecosystem reaches a new balance.

Natural systems often show a surprising resilience and manage to adapt in such a way that their key patterns and relationships sustain despite changing conditions. But, as they become less robust and resilient, at some point they may break down and some-thing new may replace them. Such a change trajectory – which can seem as if nothing much changes then, all of a sudden, everything changes – is called episodic or punc-tuated change [17]. We observe in the fossil record, for example, that there are times when there is a prolific explosion of extinctions with a myriad of new species emerg-ing; then there are other periods which remain stable for millennia. This is punctuated equilibrium.31

One version of this irreversible shift into a new regime is that of runaway, nonlinear, exponential change. But one of the issues that policy makers face is that we humans are not habituated to imagine irreversible shifts or runaway change. Partly we have an implicit belief that ‘things’ naturally find balance so that environmental or indeed eco-nomic collapse are really quite unlikely [68]. Equally, our brains, shaped by the modern-ist era of mechanical thinking, tend to expect change to be incremental and reversible. 292 Section VIII On the Global



We expect that change will be like weight gain; if we eat a little bit too much, all we have to do is to eat a bit less and we will return to normal. We are conditioned to think that there is a straightforward relationship between what we do and what happens as a result. Handling the idea of time delays between input and output, or of grappling with the concept that positive feedback loops between systemic causal factors can create runaway change, seem alien to how we have been conditioned to think.

We saw this in the response to the pandemic. Politicians wanted proof before reacting, but there was no time to wait for incontrovertible evidence; locking down one day ear-lier or later had a massive impact on the rise of cases.



Implications for practice



The question I am raising is: Given catastrophic or runaway change is becoming even more common and problematic in a world that – for a variety of interconnected en-vironmental and social reasons – is experiencing weakening stability and resilience, what practices are needed to ensure we do not react too late?

Allow ‘runaway thoughts’: First, we have to allow into our worldview the idea of un-stoppable, sudden catastrophic change. In a complex world, such change is not unlike-ly, particularly when taken-for-granted social or environmental stabilities are showing signs of wear. But we prefer to push this thought away, in part due to the feelings of loss of control that it evokes. The international development community is aware of this tendency in relation to ‘calling’ a drought. If a drought is called too late, it becomes impossible to arrest the numbers of deaths; but the counter argument is that if it is called too early, it will be very costly.

Build early alert systems: Analysis ‘after the fact’ of the drought of 2012 in Northeast Africa suggested that part of the problem was that it can be hard to trust and rely on the views of people ‘on the ground’ – those who have seen it before and can predict reasonably accurately when things are dire.32 We are often uncomfortable to work with qualitative data and respond to subtle signs. We prefer to use concrete data – temperature readings and rainfall – in order to be sure. But in these fast-changing situations, while we wait to be sure by objective means, or overly rely on predictive models, it can become ‘too late’ if change is fast and exponential.

We thus need to invest in building relationships with those nearest to the issues, those who might have a more intuitive sense of change born out of experience. This includes experts who have studied disease trajectories or environmental collapse, as well as those on the ground who have a more historically shaped and embodied sense of what is happening. Setting up ways to sense the environment, and to engage with a wide range of actors and experts, is a pre-cursor to sensing into runaway change. These are ‘early warning systems’.

67 Run, run, run, run, runaway 293



Yesterday is often not a good predictor of tomorrow: Returning to climate change, it is as if the human mind does not easily accept or grasp that yesterday and today are not always good predictors of tomorrow. But, when several different indicators of chang-es to climate show substantial shifts in very short timescales, and when measures on many fronts far transcend the averages and standard deviations that we have seen be-fore, we need to take the situation seriously.

There are, of course, many reasons why facing up to signs of global heating is so dif-ficult quite apart from the problem of embracing the exponential. I’m thinking of the power of vested interests, and the short-termism of both politicians and business lead-ers alike. But the point remains, the hope that things will change a little, incrementally, and then, if things get too much, we can make a few adjustments and things will go back to normal, does still tend to lurk within conventional thinking.

Embracing the possibility, indeed, increasingly, the probability of nonlinear runaway catastrophic change, is one necessary shift in mindset that we ignore at our peril.

Free markets: free for whom?



Considering the justification for a free-market ideology and illustrating that complexity

theory suggests this is likely to lead to increasing inequality. Exploring the importance of de-

termining the goals of economic systems, the importance of values and the role of the state.



Complexity theory demonstrates that resilience in systems requires diversity and balance. When some aspects hold too much sway, systems can lose this balance and lose their ability to adapt to changing circumstances and mediate shocks. This is the case for ecologies, and it is equally the case for societies and economies. In this piece, I focus on resilience in the economy and ask whether the adoption of free mar-ket economics has had an impact on that resilience.



Free market economics and the ‘lock-in’ of inequality



Since the 1980s, led by the US and UK, free market ideologies have become adopted as policy by the large majority of societies. The approach is based on the argument that if markets can be as free as possible, then choice and competition will drive inno-vation and excellence. More than that, the ‘invisible hand’33 in line with the principles of ‘natural law’, will supposedly ensure that the economy self-organises into a resilient, self-balancing system. There is a belief that there is something natural about balance – and hence systems, including economic systems, will spontaneously tend to such a balance.

This natural law is felt to exercise some sort of coercive surveillance … some sort

of meliorative trend over the sequence of events and give it a spiritual stability”.

Thorstein Veblen34

Free market economics is further validated through taking the view that people tend to act in their own self-interest. A free market is thus deemed to take advantage of, and indeed encourage, such self-interested choice-making. The argument goes that if we each choose what we, selfishly and immediately, want, then the market, according-ly, can seamlessly respond. Regulation is viewed as a distorting factor on this natural process towards balance.

Neoliberal [free market] orthodoxy holds that economic freedom is the basis of every

other kind. That orthodoxy is not only false, it is devouring itself. Joseph Stiglitz35



The adoption of free market or laissez-faire36 economics sets the trend for deregulation and, in many parts of the world, for a diminution of the role of the state. All is to be left to market forces and governments are to be viewed primarily as bodies who deal with 296 Section VIII On the Global



so-called market failures – aspects of society that are better served by means other than market competition, such as education, or the maintenance of law and order.

What we learn from complexity theory, though, is that self-organising processes do not necessarily lead to resilience, even in nature. There is potential for the strong to get stronger; they lock-in their advantage and lock out any competition [14].

So, it will come as no surprise that unregulated self-organising processes in econom-ic systems do not inevitably lead to a diverse, balanced, innovative economy offering choice. In the words of Joseph Stiglitz, “there is no invisible hand”.37 If firms start to have some success and win out over their rivals, they can use their economic power and wealth to control supply chains, or artificially lower prices for a while to put small-er firms out of business; they can lobby governments and sway consumers through their advertising campaigns; they can capture the market and lock-in their advantage.

Once an outcome begins to emerge it becomes progressively more locked-in.

Brian Arthur38



Richard Bronk in The Romantic Economist, agrees. He says that economies almost nev-er “settle down into a predictable equilibrium” because, and he quotes Brian Arthur, economies are “process dependent, organic and always evolving”.39

Where does this lead? We move towards an economy with fewer players and with less choice. We ‘inherit an economic process that polarises and accelerates economic inequality – where there is little to stop those that have power using their power to protect their patch and strive for a bigger share of the pie. This tendency for the rich to get richer and the powerful to get more powerful has not escaped the notice of various commentators, as the following quotations show.

The hegemony of uncontrolled profit (a major cause of the ecological crisis) increases

inequalities within each nation and across the entire planet. The qualities of our civili-

zation have deteriorated, and its deficiencies have increased, notably in the spread of

selfishness and the disappearance of traditional solidarities. Edgar Morin40

Within a market economy, there are no transactions between equals. Some traders en-

joy the backing of huge military machines, others have access to subsidies not enjoyed

by their competitors … competitiveness is thus less a reflection of the ‘natural advan-

tages’ enjoyed by traders as of the historical, geopolitical and organisational advantag-

es they enjoy. Colin Hines41

Capitalism claims … to allow people to act as one pleases without oppressive restric-

tions, however, the reality is quite the opposite when the majority of the population

becomes ‘locked-in’ by poverty and the systematic exploitation of their labour.42

There is also hard evidence, some listed below, of this trend towards inequality; it makes for uncomfortable reading.

68 Free markets: free for whom? 297



Has the world become more unequal?

It is interesting to note that (in 2022) the ten wealthiest people, all men, have a com-

bined net worth of $1.5 trillion.43 That is half the economy of Africa, an economy of 1.37

billion people. The ten biggest companies manage about $16 trillion44 of the world’s

wealth and just under half of the world’s wealth is held by 1% of its population.45 There

are capital concentrations in Sovereign Wealth Funds, the Chinese State, Russian oli-

garchs, South Korean chaebol, asset management firms and billionaire entrepreneurs.46

As Cliff Bowman says, “this level of capital concentration has not existed on a global

scale before”.47

There is also evidence of growing inequality between leaders and workers. For exam-

ple, in 1965, CEOs in the US earned twenty times an average worker’s salary; the figure

in 2019, was 278.48 Total CEO compensation growth (remuneration plus benefits) rose

1,007.5% from 1978 to 2018, and for workers over the same period increased by just

11.9%.49



Increasing inequality – does it matter?



It is only fair to ask whether this tendency towards growing economic inequality matters? One argument is that, if the economy keeps growing, then it can be deemed acceptable if the gap between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ widens, as those at the bottom still have more than they used to have; they are ‘pulled up by their bootstrings’. This ‘trickle down’ argument does, however, depend on continuing growth; I explore, in [69], whether never-ending growth is either feasible or desirable.

Putting aside the way growth has, to a degree, masked increasing inequality, growing inequality still seems problematic for at least two reasons.

First, ‘the poor’ may come to feel aggrieved. They are told they are better off than they used to be, and they are told that there is equality of opportunity [65], hence it is large-ly their own fault if they are poorer, or feel poorer, than they would like. This can breed dissatisfaction and social unrest, drive migration, and is seen as a key reason for the rise in populism reported worldwide.50

With regard to social unrest, I note, for example, in the UK in 2023, that nurses went on strike over pay for the first time in thirty years. In that same year, the then UK Housing Secretary suggested that failure to solve the housing crisis would threaten democracy and could turn young people towards authoritarianism.51 If societies become too un-balanced, if too many people cannot manage economically, eventually people start to react. And history suggests this can have serious consequences, as illustrated by the following study.



298 Section VIII On the Global



History’s crisis detectives

A study by Daniel Hoyer looks back at earlier points of societal crisis and pinpoints

what led to collapse.52 Hoyer explains that “extreme inequality shows up in nearly every

case”. He continues: “When big gaps exist between the haves and have-nots, not just in

material wealth but also access to positions of power, this breeds frustration, dissent

and turmoil” and ushers in an age of discord.

Hoyer points out that one of the most surprising factors is that inequality seems to be

just as corrosive for the elites themselves. This, he says, is because the accumulation of

so much wealth and power leads to intense infighting between them, and this ripples

throughout society. Typically, wealth is related to power, as elites try to secure top po-

sitions in political office. He explains that history shows how this rivalry can lead to the

breaking of rules and social taboos in order to stay ahead of the game. And, he finds,

once the taboo of refraining from civil violence falls – as it too often does – the results

are typically devastating.

Put together, fiercely competitive elites alongside scores of poor and marginalised peo-

ple create an extremely combustible situation. This is because elites tend to capture the

lion’s share of wealth, often at the expense of both the majority of the population and of

state institutions. So just when a society most needs its leaders in government and the

civil service to step up and turn the crisis around, it finds itself at its weakest point and

is unfit for the challenge. This is one of the main reasons, Hoyer concludes, that so many

historical crises turn into major catastrophes.



Secondly, as inequality grows, the future of the planet is held increasingly in the hands of a relatively small number of wealthy individuals and institutions, whose main objec-tive is to win at the economic game. These business leaders are not tasked with being the guardians of the future, or the champions of the poor – but they now have more power over the future impact of growth and inequality and its consequences for the planet than any government or global institution.



Can we redress the balance?



If inequality is problematic, then are there ways to counter its drift and redress the bal-ance? I address two related aspects: one centres on the role of individual and societal values, and the second focuses on the role of the state.

Values



Values, some would argue, are intrinsically linked with the economy. Clearly, a sup-posed value-free laissez-faire economy places a high value on the freedom to make money. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, highlighted, in his Reith lectures of 2020, the importance of reflecting on values in relation to the econ-omy.53 He expressed the view that Adam Smith’s moral sentiments have been replaced by market sentiments, and that societal values have become equated with financial

68 Free markets: free for whom? 299



value.54 His point is that what the economy delivers depends on what we want it to deliver. If we preference short-term profit above all else, we will reach a different out-come than if we also value long-term resilience, the husbanding of resources, fairness and social justice. As he says, “markets don’t exist in a vacuum, the market is a social construct whose effectiveness is determined partly by the rules of the state and partly by the values of society”.55

Why do financial markets rate Amazon as one of the world’s most valuable companies,

but the value of the vast region of the Amazon appears on no ledger until it’s stripped

of its foliage and converted into farmland?



And how can we reconcile our celebrations of the extraordinary values of public ser-

vice dedication and the heroism of healthcare workers with their low wages and per-

ilous working conditions? These are all issues of how we get what we value. Carney56

In the UK, after the Second World War, there tended to be a strong collective societal desire for people to pull together, transcending issues of class and education (if not, at that time, race and gender). There was acceptance that to maintain a resilient and fair society, people needed to consider each other and cooperate, to balance personal needs with the needs of the community. This was the time in the UK when the wel-fare state, the health service and free education were all established. Indeed, from the 1950s to the 1970s, working class people really were able, for the first time before or since, to create a new life for themselves and really were upwardly mobile.57

This approach is an example of what has come to be known as social capitalism. Social capitalism is structured to engage with the tensions between liberty, equality, and jus-tice. It proposes an economy that values quality of life, happiness and the natural world as well as profit and growth.58

The role of the state



Second, there is the question of role of the state.

Self-regulating markets never work; their deficiencies, not only in their internal work-

ings but also in their consequences (e.g., for the poor) are so great that government

becomes necessary. Stiglitz 59

The state to shape economic priorities: Mariana Mazzucato, an economist current-ly having great impact on government policy worldwide, advocates “stronger more empowered states”.60 Governments are not just there, she says, to tackle market failures, but should be setting broad goals and articulating the key priorities for our time – goals, she suggests, such as tackling climate change, or inequality, or the chal-lenges of an ageing population. Setting such systemic long-term strategic “missions”61 as she calls them, allows public and private sector to work together to achieve them. This both calls out and shapes the direction for investment and innovation, enabling “bottom-up experimentation and learning”. She believes these missions are often first 300 Section VIII On the Global



identified and lobbied for by civil society and then are picked up by political leadership. She is clear that these missions “should focus on creating system-wide transformation across sectors”.

Mazzucato gives an example of Germany’s Energiewende policy, initiated by bottom-up green movements, which culminated, she says, in political understanding and eventu-ally in leadership from above. She explains that Germany’s development of green steel, using its state development bank KfW, made loans conditional on the introduction of environmentally friendly technologies.



An example of missions in action: Wales Future Generations Commissioner

In 2016, Wales established a Future Generations Commissioner whose office is setting

a number of future missions.62 For example, its manifesto states that: “We will make it

our mission to help transition Wales to an economy that puts people and planet first. As

a result, governments at all levels, communities and businesses are making this happen.”

It is establishing similar mission statements for climate and wellbeing, sharing stories of

good practice, and convening and funding initiatives that bring together public, private

and not-for-profits.



The state to protect public goods: Another question in relation to the role of the state regards the protection of the public commons. Guy Standing, in The Blue Commons, describes how common land and oceans used to be regarded as a shared heritage, a resource belonging to everyone. Governments used to steward and defend such re-sources, for now and for the future. These days, he says, the commons are treated as the property of governments to be exploited and ‘plundered’. 63 A notable exception is the way the Norwegian government has treated income from their oil fields; they invested it in a sovereign wealth fund to be used to fund Norway’s social costs.64

Governments should also, arguably, resist the temptation to sell off public goods for ‘ready cash’. For example, in the UK in 1989, water companies were privatised. Was the way this was undertaken in the best interests of the public, given that the companies manage and control public goods for private profit? How well do we hold these and other companies to account for polluting rivers and seas? The dumping of raw sewage is becoming a huge issue for the UK, one which water companies seem unable to re-solve, given their shareholders are starting to abandon them as their profits diminish.65



Resilience and the middle ground …



Is it not for the government to ensure that there are effective governance frameworks to mediate between the drives of the commercial sector and the interests of the peo-ple? Commercial organisations indeed often argue for rules that create a level playing field, such as a carbon tax or a minimum wage.66 Ha Joon Chang explains, in 23 Things They Don’t Tell You about Capitalism, that even in largely deregulated economies, there are always exist some regulations, laws and practices.67 The trick, ideally, is to ensure

68 Free markets: free for whom? 301



that these act to support economic balance and do not just ease the path of the win-ners. These may include, he suggests, anti-monopoly legislation, a focus on human and workers’ rights, the right to protest and the right to a fair trial.

What makes for societal and economic resilience with the long-term future of the plan-et in mind, tend to be middle ground solutions, with not too much power in the hands of the state and, equally, not too much power in the hands of the private sector. Equally, there needs to be a balance between valuing individual freedom and emphasising the needs of the whole community. Mature ecologies are resilient if they are able to main-tain diversity and maintain dynamic balance. If they become too unbalanced, they can-not adapt. In similar vein, societies that become too unequal are hard to change organ-ically as power is locked-in either by the state, or by the wealthy. And, of course, there are many examples where political leaders become extremely rich as well as politically powerful. Resilient economies encourage innovation and enterprise, thus maintaining a balance between the small, medium and large and the dynamic interplay between them.68 There is also a need for defending independent voices. Resilient societies pro-tect the right to speak out and preserve the freedoms of mediating bodies such as the judiciary and the press. I explore this further in ‘Who got the power’[70].

Does the economy have to be predicated on growth?



Questioning the possibility of unfettered economic growth and exploring other options.

Our current global economy is structured around growth and depends on growth to function. Governments rely on growing taxes to fund welfare. Firms need to demon-strate growth in profits and increased market share to attract and retain investors. Many corporations prioritise the short-term interests of shareholders in order to maintain their loyalty and attract new investors.

There are companies who do recognise and address their adverse impact on society and the planet. The rise of interest in the UN sustainable development goals, and cor-porate success in managing impact, show there is some progress, albeit slow and in-consistent.69 But growth is rarely questioned as the ultimate target to ensure success. Does it have to be this way? Is growth both necessary and inevitable? The intense drive for growth is predicated on the particular form of capitalism that has evolved in a par-ticular fashion, and then been embedded and instituted through custom and practice, and the law. But its form, and the rules that structure the economy, are not set in stone, although it can feel that way. Usury, for example, used to be illegal and now is a central feature of our economics processes.70 The rules that economics processes follow are not incontestable ‘laws of nature’; the economy could, and, in some places, does operate in different ways. It is hard, but not impossible, to challenge and reframe.

This is a topic that remains difficult to raise. Economic growth has, without doubt, im-proved the living standards of hundreds of millions. For example, over the past forty years, the number of people in China with incomes below $1.90 per day – the Inter-national Poverty Line as defined by the World Bank to track global extreme poverty – has fallen by close to 800 million.71 We wealthy Westerners hardly have the right to inform the developing world that their citizens cannot have the ways of life we have engineered for ourselves although, as I will argue, growth does not have to be the only way out of poverty. Growth, too, is partly driven by increases in population, which, globally, has more than doubled in the last fifty years.72 And with the current system of investment and taxation, fear of stagnation engenders much cause for concern.

Here’s the hard truth. We are living in the twilight of this age [of exponential growth]

Matthew Syed73



The problem lies, however, in whether the planet can continue to provide the resourc-es that are needed to sustain unfettered growth. Technology enthusiasts believe that technological advances will stave off the point at which resources run out, as we find alternative and less resource-intensive ways of doing things. The expected reduction in the global population will have a positive impact too and surely, at some stage, we will decarbonise?

304 Section VIII On the Global



But … the scientist in me is convinced that, in the end, be it in decades or longer, we will eventually run out of land, minerals and water. There is no infinite source of supply. Coupled with the distinct possibility, indeed the likelihood, of runaway global heating, the availability of these resources will further reduce as land becomes unusable for farming, as forests die, and as the ocean becomes too warm or too saline to support marine life. Global heating is also likely to accelerate migration — as regions are sub-merged under water or become too hot or too dry for habitation. Climate change is also likely to lead to iniquitous ways of gaining control over ever-scarcer resources. For example, Ukraine is regarded as a mineral superpower. It has the second largest gas reserves in Europe, the Donbas region boasts one of the largest coal deposits in the world, and Ukraine has 117 of the 120 most widely used metals and minerals.74 Is the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia driven primarily – or at least in part – by a desire to control these resources?



Are there ways to limit growth?



The issue of Limits to Growth was posed by Donella Meadows and others in 1972.75 Can we limit growth, and indeed does it make sense to consider degrowth? A recent article in Nature, Degrowth can Work,76 explores how this could function. The article suggests, for example, that governments should find more creative ways to fund them-selves than primarily through taxes on profits and income. They advocate that govern-ments stop subsidies for fossil fuel extraction and instead tax ecologically damaging industries. This is in line with Mazzucato’s suggestions that governments should take a stronger lead in creating a future vision and in setting the parameters in which the private sector operates [68]. This is of course complexified when political leaders are entwined in various ways with the business world.

Kate Raworth in Doughnut Economics has developed an elegant way to think about lim-its to growth.77 She starts with the argument, in line with Carney [68], that the econ-omy’s purpose should be to promote human prosperity and happiness. It should pro-vide everyone with the material resources to pursue their highest dreams – but not through irreversibly depleting the planet’s resources. Raworth likens the economy to a doughnut. The inner circle represents the zone of deprivation, and the outer circle represents the limits of economic growth as set by the planet’s natural resources. We have to remain in the dough of the doughnut!



‘Sweating’ natural resources through intensive farming?

One way that technology can extend the limits of resource usage is intensive farming.

But are there consequences? Philip Lymbery78 tells the story of going for a walk in rural

southeast England; he watched a huge field being ploughed and noticed, as did the

Walrus and the Carpenter, in Lewis Carroll’s poem, that ‘no birds were flying overhead’.

Lymbery realised this was because the soil was inert – there were no worms to attract

69 Does the economy have to be predicated on growth? 305



them. He explained that factory farms rearing thousands of animals require huge

factory farming of grains to feed them. These grains tend to be grown as monocul-

tures, and this depletes the soil and relies on enormous quantities of fertiliser. Such

an approach is efficient in the short-term but has concerning long-term implications.

Lymbery advocates crop and animal rotation to naturally enrich the soil.

This tendency to create efficiencies of scale for single crops impacts soil health and of-

ten also impacts livelihoods for local farmers, particularly in regions of the world where

much land is held as commons and then can be sold by governments to foreign corpora-

tions.79 Furthermore, the concentrating of crops in particular regions of the world, such

as wheat in Ukraine, can also lead to issues of food security as well as the weaponizing

of food and other crops in times of war. So, the interconnections between economic

gain, unscrupulous political practices at the expense of powerless citizens, environ-

mental degradation, questionable animal-rearing practices, and the weaponizing of

food availability globally, proffers yet another example of the need to consider issues

systemically and not let one factor – in this case, cheap meat – run out of control.



Examples of economies that are less dependent on growth



Are there alternative economic models? The German Mittelstand seems to provide one type of solution, an example of social capitalism in action. The Mittelstand, made up primarily of privately-owned medium-sized firms, and employing sixty percent of the workforce, is often described as the heart of the German economy, accounting for the bulk of economic output.80 The German economy thus is less driven than in the US and the UK by the stock market, with its need for short-term profits to satisfy share-holders. Private ownership allows for longer timescales (not needing to show profits to shareholders every quarter), allows firms to bed into their communities, care for their workers, invest in education for the next generation of workers, and protect the local environment. The Mittelstand has engendered a more systemic approach that balances economic success with social and environmental needs. It has held its place against economics giants. And it has proven itself to be more resilient to crisis.81

Another approach that is gaining traction is the idea of a circular economy.82 A circu-lar economy is a model of resource production and consumption that involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. There may be local ‘share shops’ where items not often used – such as a chainsaw or a carpet cleaner – can be donated and then borrowed. There may be community fridges where local shops and restaurants can donate food that would otherwise be thrown away; there may be clothes swaps, plant and seed swaps, repair shops, and lessons in remaking clothes. Often there is a focus on buying locally made goods, using local renewable sources of energy, and sourcing raw materials in the vicinity as much as possible. The philosophy of the circular economy also applies to industrial processes as exemplified by demonstrator projects in the Tees Valley.83 It was announced yesterday (as I write this in Spring 2024) that the UK is to establish the 306 Section VIII On the Global



world’s first UN-backed centre for circular economy research.84 I am not suggesting an economy can be entirely local, but a move in that direction can both reduce growth and limit carbon emissions.

One reason why even socially-minded governments are so concerned to even raise the issue of limiting growth is that the funding of public services would need, in large part, to come through taxes. Taxing those of middle income and higher is without doubt an option that needs further discussion, particularly in the light of increasing inequality. Today’s middle classes are often very comfortable indeed. In principle, poverty can be reduced by tackling inequality as much as by relying on growth. Easy to say and hard to implement, given locked-in interests, but surely this is a topic that should be on the table?

In terms of approaches to change, one promising aspect of circular economy mod-els is that they are appearing within and alongside business as usual. As discussed in [57], change can sometimes be triggered by new approaches emerging from within the current situation. Furthermore, in our social history, we have a resonance with this circular approach through the norms in the time of our (great) grandparents and forebears. It used to be customary to ‘borrow a cup of sugar’, so to speak, as well as to make and repair clothes, grow and swop food, and barter for various goods and ser-vices. Re-purposing approaches such as this – approaches which used to be common practice – can instil us with the confidence that they can work, and thus makes them easier to adopt.

The real difficulty in limiting growth is to find ways to challenge those with current economic power, particularly when many also have political power. But if and when we start to reach the limits of the planet to fund our habits, if we get close to environmen-tal collapse, the potential for major global social unrest becomes a distinct possibility. Jared Diamond in Collapse85 tells many stories of what happens to deeply unequal so-cieties when the population starts to starve, and when they no longer have anything to lose. William Dalrymple and Anita Anand, in their podcast Empire, give several instanc-es of the rise and fall of empires – some of which held huge sway over large regions for decades, if not centuries, and are now virtually forgotten.86 The issue we face today is that the whole earth is so interconnected that it can almost be viewed as a single ‘em-pire’ in the way it functions.

Doesn’t this global weaving of the social, economic and environment, and the implica-tions of widening inequality in the face of diminishing resources, require greater atten-tion? We have to take seriously the possibility of global collapse and, surely, we have to challenge the inevitability of unfettered growth.

Who got the power? I got the power87



Various political writers describe the world in terms very recognisable to the complexity

thinker, and proffer both an analysis of how democratic freedoms erode and suggestions as

to how to stop this before ‘power in the hands of the few’ becomes too locked-in.



A focus on the dynamics of power



As a global citizen sporting a complexity hat, I am concerned to understand what con-tributes to the coalescing of political and other forms of power into the hands of the few. This is driven through the accumulation of wealth, and also through the dynamics of political processes. Indeed, the two are often closely interlinked. In the following, I explore:

Is this move to power inevitable? What are the steps towards power-grabbing?

How can we prevent it from happening? What can we do when power has become

entrenched?

Pursuing these questions has led me to uncover a number of very interesting political writers and I build in particular on their work.

Political writers building on lived experience



One such political writer is Maria Ressa; her book How to Stand up to a Dictator is well worth reading.88 Ressa, a Filipina educated in America who returned to her country of origin, set out to challenge political corruption. I find it intriguing that her insights fit so well with those of process complexity. What also attracts me to her writing, and that of other political writers I will mention, is that these are the deliberations of thought-ful people seeking to lead impactful lives. These are not theoretical discourses. They are contemplating their ‘lived experience’, and their reflections tend to be nuanced and provide a subtlety of perspective that really illuminates how to navigate this complex world. I like the fact that they sometimes disentangle complex issues in ways that are fresh to me, and hence lead me into a whole new set of considerations.

I also came across Turkish journalist Ece Temelkuran’s How to Lose a Country: Seven Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship,89 Chantal Mouffe’s works on populism,90 and The Power of the Powerless by Vaclev Havel.91 Havel became Czechoslovakia’s President af-ter the Velvet Revolution and this book gives his take on how small acts of resistance, and giving sway to ‘being authentic’, can make a difference.

308 Section VIII On the Global



Path dependence and lock-in



As always, I am interested in the links with process complexity, and I suggest that the core idea that underpins these expositions on power is path dependence [15]. The future is co-created by the actions that we, collectively, take. These actions are influ-enced by our interactions, by how we engage with and impact each other. And our in-teractions are both influenced by, and give shape to, the cultural milieu in which we find ourselves. By cultural milieu, I mean the norms and beliefs of the societies, fam-ilies and institutions of which we are a part. These norms and ways of ‘thinking and being’ have developed over time and tend to become relatively stable. We may re-gard them as so self-evidently ‘normal’ or ‘obvious’ that we are hardly aware of them. These cultural norms, however, shape to what we, and our society, pay attention; they shape our choices, decisions and actions. As with process complexity, the idea of the path is central to Daoism; in Buddhism, path dependence is an expression of collective Karma92 – collectively, we reap what we sow [15].

These political writers proffer a common warning: If we let things pass – things of which we don’t really approve – it becomes increasingly hard, and even dangerous, to oppose them at a later stage. They are talking about the steps on the path towards the growth and consolidation of power. Hannah Arendt, for example, coined the phrase “the ba-nality of evil” to describe the most extreme failures of personal moral awareness.93 As Sarah Bakewell explains in At the Existentialist Café: If you do not respond when times demand it, if you show a lack of imagination and attention, these behaviours become as dangerous as “deliberately committing an abuse”.94

This path-dependent consolidation of power leads us to the related concept, in com-plexity language, of lock-in. There comes a point, a so-called tipping point, beyond which the powerful can invincibly consolidate their power through terror, or through changing laws and institutions, or stuffing the system with cronies [17]. Their power becomes increasingly impossible to challenge and overturn. This can occur in democ-racies as well as in more expressly autocratic regimes, and the warning is that dem-ocratic processes can gradually and imperceptibly and – ultimately irreversibly – be eroded.

The lure of power



Why do people want this sort of political power? Political power seekers may merely enjoy the feeling of power and become addicted to their ability to sway the masses; they may have no obvious ideology or intention and may indeed shift course and be prepared to do or say whatever it takes to remain in power, just for the thrill that they can. Yet others may have strong beliefs or intentions – to purify the race, to make their empire great again, or to oppose the ‘infidels’. The authors I describe point to the view that all beliefs and ideologies, when they become singular and oppositional, when they propose ‘there is only one right way’ with little nuance or attention to alternatives, can lead even well-intentioned leaders to become ‘economical with the truth’ and take actions not congruent even with their own espoused values. This elision of the truth

70 Who got the power? I got the power 309



is justified as a way to create the conditions whereby the outcome they believe to be in the public good can be realised. The desired ‘end’ is used to justify the sometimes shady and questionable ‘means’ they are prepared to take. Complexity theory warns that, whilst the outcomes may not be achieved, the ‘means taken’ will impart an inevi-table signature on that which unfolds [15].

The end cannot justify the means, for the simple and obvious reason that the means

employed determine the nature of the ends produced. Aldous Huxley



I want to focus on two key questions addressed in the works I have mentioned:

What leads to the concentration of power in the hands of the few; and what

do you do about it?



How does power become concentrated in the hands of the few?



Here is a checklist of what you would do well to do if you want to capture political power.

(a) Control the truth



Ressa and Temelkuran describe the ascendence of the so-called post-truth era. Te-melkuran exemplifies this with a quote from the New York Times, in which an aide of George W. Bush, was mocking those in “what we call a reality-based community … people who believe that solutions emerge from the judicious study of discernible real-ity”. He went on: “That’s not the way it works any more … we create our own reality.”95 This was back in 2004; now, in 2024, talk of post-truth and fake news is in common parlance, and, as Temelkuran says, many would argue these days that it is naïve even to expect politicians or leaders to tell the truth when a lie or obfuscation will be more effective.

Studies show that lies laced with anger and hate spread faster and farther than facts.

Ressa96



Ressa is exercised by this same issue, and she explores in particular how social me-dia has amplified this slide into disinformation and fake news. She says that, earlier on, social media used to do the opposite of this. For example, social media, around the time of the Arab Spring and Occupy movements in 2011, helped to surface untruths promoted by power seekers; it also allowed challenge, the pooling of group knowledge and provided platforms for connecting people together. Ressa herself set up Rappler in 2012 – an online news site in the Philippines, which invites citizens to provide sto-ries, pictures and information that help to combat any official line. Rappler continues to work to expose corruption and disinformation and Ressa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021.

310 Section VIII On the Global



I saw then [in 2011] how powerful participatory media can be: how citizens using their

cell phones are enfranchised to demand justice and accountability. It showed me how

technology could be used for good: for citizen empowerment, voting and democratic

engagement, and integrity and truth. Ressa97

Ressa is particularly concerned about the automated processes used in social media; these can achieve massive influence by attacking those ‘speaking truth to power’ and can spread slurs and disinformation. Corrupt politicians are able to make enormous use of such processes. She points to the way algorithms aimed at increasing traffic on social media find that incendiary posts which attack or are extreme are the most pop-ular. Social media companies are thus not incentivised to remove such posts, or ban their perpetrators, as such posts bring in traffic and hence profit. But these algorithms, through feeding us what we want to hear, can increase polarisation of perspectives and work against tolerance, pluralism and the handling of the real paradox of living in a complex world. Maria Ressa does not mince her words. She says:

Those very same developments that I welcomed in 2011 would soon be fine-tuned by

the platforms’ business models, co-opted by state power, and turned against the peo-

ple, fuelling the rise of digital authoritarians, the death of facts, and the insidious mass

manipulation we live with today. We are conditioned to prefer sensationalism over

objectivity.98



That is not to suggest that there is Certain Truth [5]. But equally, that is not to say that there are not untruths, deliberately spread to achieve particular outcomes. Some types of ‘facts’ do seem pretty certain. For example, aerial photographs can reliably show the reduction in the size of the Amazon rainforest, and we have reasonable certainty about the numbers of deaths due to disease, or levels of population growth, or changes in corporate profits. Searching for facts and aiming to fact-check may still not lead to Truth but it may expose untruths and trace ways in which untruths have been gener-ated and spread.

(b) Rewrite the past



Ressa describes how actions in the present can work backwards to reshape old memo-ries and perspectives; we can rewrite the past. Ressa explains how she became alerted to this idea through an essay by T. S. Eliot. In this, Eliot describes how “the way you read William Shakespeare is affected by the last novel you read, and the last novel you read is affected by the fact that you read Shakespeare”.99 What it made Ressa understand is that memory of the past can be distorted by new influences – influences which may indeed be designed to mislead. Disinformation can rehabilitate the track record of ear-lier leaders and bring back to popularity those with a sometimes-questionable public record;100 it can be used as a form of collective and intentional gaslighting.

70 Who got the power? I got the power 311



I realise that the past is re-examined regularly, as we explore the narratives around, for example, colonialism, where history was in the main written by the victors; deciding what is ‘true’ is not straightforward. But that is not to ignore the deliberate burying or misrepresenting of past events with the sole intention of gaining power.

(c) Create an ideology



Havel, in The Power of the Powerless, reflected on what led to the success of Soviet-led communism. His thoughts, though, are relevant to the role of any entrenched ideology. He explains that, as power coalesces around them, ideologies start to be treated as un-assailable truth. He argues that this is problematic when it becomes impossible to take an opposing view, or to challenge or even discuss it. If you want to join the ‘winners’, you may need to act as if you swallow whole the requisite ideology.

This intention of the state to dominate and shape the culture of a society – the beliefs, perceptions, values and mores – so that the required worldview becomes the accepted cultural norm, is known as cultural hegemony.101 People accept current norms as natu-ral and cannot imagine an alternative.

By not confronting systems built on a questionable ideology, Havel says people “live within a lie”. “But”, he continues, “they need not [even] accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it. For, by this very fact, individuals con-firm the system, fulfil the system, make the system, are the system”.102

It is one thing to recognise the power of ideology in the starkness of a totalitarian re-gime, but Mouffe and Temelkuran further suggest that this argument applies to the adoption of any ideology. Belief in the free market, or in individualism or growth, can equally become problematic if it becomes politically inexpedient and impossible to challenge them, in order to remain ‘within the camp’. In this way, Havel says, ideology “has a natural tendency to disengage itself from reality, to create a world of appearanc-es, to become ritual”.103

(d) Let them laugh at the horror



In her book How to Lose a Country: The Seven Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship, Te-melkuran, basing her themes on observations of what has happened in modern-day Turkey, identifies “let them laugh at the horror” as a technique to concentrate power.104 Early on, as she remarks, people are prone not to take seriously rather extreme lead-ers who are setting out seemingly ridiculous agendas. People – other politicians and citizens – laugh at them. She makes the interesting point that laughing at someone can make you feel that you are taking action against them. But, she reminds us, you are not. Those hungry for power may be inured to mockery or even embrace it for what it gives them – publicity and a sort of disguise.

312 Section VIII On the Global



(e) Enfeeble the processes of ‘checks and balances’



Another step in Temelkuran’s list focuses on how, when power is gained, those seeking to cement their leadership will work to reduce the institutional powers of bodies such as the judiciary or the civil service – bodies which serve as ‘checks and balances’ in relation to the executive. Power seekers will endeavour to promote cronies and those of like mind into positions of power. They may indeed seek to change laws in order to criminalise active dissent or relax opposition to monopolies in press ownership; they may make themselves immune from the law. We may experience a weakening of the legal challenges to politicians when they accept gifts or advantageous loans, or a lessening of consequences if they are exposed for telling untruths or breaking rules of conduct.

The emergence of an ever-more-powerful Executive can, Havel argues, ultimately take on a life of its own. Leaders may become “the blind executors of the system’s own inter-nal laws”. Furthermore, the system is likely to become “far more powerful than the will of any individual” and hence, when instituted, hard to shift.105 Havel continues: If some-one does possess a more independent will, he will need to “conceal it behind a ritually anonymous mask in order to have an opportunity to enter the power hierarchy at all”.

(f) Establish a Faustian pact between the powerful and powerless



Another perspective that has really stayed with me since I came across it a long time ago, comes from When Society becomes an Addict by Anne Wilson Schaef, published in 1987.106 Schaef starts with an exploration of the mechanical worldview [3]. As she says, treating the world as if it works like a machine suggests that we can understand it using reason and logic alone. And she argues that if things are objective and certain, with clear links between cause and effect, then we can analyse and consequently control this machine. Hence, it makes sense to have people in charge of this machine, people who know ‘best’ – because there is a best to know, and because machines are run effi-ciently by hierarchies in which someone is clearly in charge.

Paradoxically, it is not this machine perspective, but the dynamics of systemic, complex societies that create the next step in her argument – which is that when people get to be in charge, they are able to lock-in their power. In other words, the machine world-view predisposes us to accept hierarchy and the necessity for power at the top; and the complexity worldview advises how to lock it in.

Schaef goes on to say that to create stability for those in power, it is not enough to wield power. It requires others to accept that ‘power over’ is necessary and normal; ‘the peo-ple’ have to accept and expect the inevitability of their own powerlessness. Further-more, she argues, we, the people, can become addicted to powerlessness. Part of the process, she says, is to medicate the powerless through consumerism (you are being a good citizen if you consume) and through growth (actually, ‘they’ are doing a good job, evidenced by the fact that ‘we’ are getting richer). Helplessness is also medicating: ‘I can do nothing, I am just a tiny cog in this machine, so I will enjoy myself, get on with my

70 Who got the power? I got the power 313



life and leave it up to those at the top who know best.’ In these ways, we come to regard a division between the powerful and the powerless as normal; and indeed, we don’t really feel powerless as wars, climate change, poverty, pollution are ‘their’ problem, not ours. In Western democracies, we are told that we are ‘free’ individuals, with equality of opportunity, free to choose what we want, free to succeed [65]. All we have to do, we are told, is to keep our heads down and leave important matters to those in charge.

Schaef suggests that the powerful and the powerless are in a Faustian pact whereby both get what they want. The entitled ones that have taken power are allowed to do what it takes to retain that power in order that the powerless can remain innocent and avoid responsibility. If such leaders can manoeuvre themselves into the role of the protective Father, then their behaviour is often not challenged.

Authority can give us the freedom to be our worst selves. Ressa107

Each person [is capable of] succumbing to a profane trivialisation of his or her inherent

humanity … In everyone there is some willingness to merge with the anonymous crowd

and to flow comfortably along with it down the river of pseudo-life. Havel108



Fiona Hill, in her 2022 Reith lecture, also discusses the conditions that lead to a rise of authoritarian rule. People, she says, feel loss, grievance and anxiety when they sense they are losing out or getting left behind. They experience fear. Populism derives from authoritarianism, when the seemingly protective Father is building on these feelings of fear; he promises to provide security and safety as well as prosperity – as long as people acquiesce to his ultimate authority.109

(g) Appeal to technocracy



One of the ways the power machine can be held in place, according to Mouffe, is to adopt a technocratic approach to politics. Mouffe explains this approach was exempli-fied by Tony Blair, the UK Prime Minister in the 1990s. The proposition, again in line with the machine view of society, suggests that there are solutions to most of the prob-lems that governments face. If governments focus on finding these solutions and im-plementing them, then, the reasoning goes, we can all rise above party politics. Blair said: “The choice is not between a left-wing economic policy and a right-wing economic policy, but between a good economic policy and a bad one.”110 Havel covered similar ground and pointed out that “political parties run by professional apparatuses [re-lease] the citizen from all forms of concrete and personal responsibility”.111

The point is not that analysis, logic, data and expertise do not have their place. Rather it is to say that if we believe there is a ‘right answer’, we have yet another reason to leave things in the hands of those at the top, those who we can believe know more than we do, to the extent that we can become lulled into not even questioning their logic or ev-idence or intention. Blair, or any politician, may indeed have alighted on a ‘good’ strat-egy – but we, as citizens, need to continue to engage and make our own assessments, and not just assume the clever guys at the top have got it right.

314 Section VIII On the Global



Mouffe, in contrast, points out that the real issue does not reside in defining the solu-tion, but in the impossibility of agreeing on the problem. As she says, the agendas on the left in particular are much more diverse than was the case in the ‘old days’, when left/right ideologies were rooted in economic power. Now, she argues, there are many issues – climate change, gender, race – not only jobs, wealth and economic inequality; issues are prioritised and held differently by differing groups. As she says, there is no “rational answer to the different problems of society”.112

Political questions are not merely technical issues to be solved by experts; they always

involve decisions which require us to make a choice between conflicting alternatives.

Mouffe113

This is not an attack on ‘experts’ but a recognition that many factors combine, and land-ing on a solution, or indeed agreeing on the problem, is not trivial or obvious.

First, not everyone agrees on priorities: Should we focus on growth or climate change; should we prioritise ageism or racism? Secondly, values and ideologies play a part; there are disparate views as to what would be acceptable mechanisms to achieve out-comes, even if desired outcomes could be defined. Thirdly, these complexly interwo-ven social-economic-environmental problems are non-trivial and are unlikely to have clear pathways and unambiguous solutions. Political processes should, of course, work with evidence and expertise – but in the knowledge that the balance of priorities and the complex interweaving of the social with the environmental, the short-term with the long-term, means there is no simple, unique solution.



What do you do to stop power growing or catalyse its collapse?



I’ve described, based on the work of various political writers, how we become en-trenched in situations of locked-in power. I recommend their books to you, and I think their insights have an applicability for contexts wider than the political sphere, as I will discuss later.

The next question is, what can be done about it? I have been really intrigued as to how these writers advise both how to arrest the emerging of behaviour when it becomes increasingly, inexorably dictator-like, but also how to reverse situations where public freedoms are starting to disappear.

(a) Challenge early



The first suggestion is to challenge early. It must be very tempting, as a politician, to back a leader who is popular and adept at charming the public, even when you neither agree with his or her views nor see him or her as acting with integrity. The reason-ing goes that you, the politician, cannot challenge everything and, even if the leader’s methods are a bit askew, at least she is popular. Backing her might enable you yourself to be re-elected in the future. And what use will you be with no seat? So, you keep quiet

70 Who got the power? I got the power 315



and go along with things. But what both Ressa and Temelkuran are pointing out is that this acquiescence to questionable methods and behaviours is the path through which a ‘do whatever you need to succeed’ culture emerges and becomes normalised. People start to say, ‘well all politicians lie, they always have’. It can even come to seem that act-ing honestly and with integrity is weak and naïve, rather than laudable and important. Ressa calls this “the death of democracy by a thousand cuts”.114 By the time we notice, it is too late.

(b) Set your personal moral compass and ‘draw your line’



The political writers discussed here display their interest in a world that is compas-sionate, equal and sustainable. They express the view that, in order to get there, we each need to reflect on our personal moral stance. Ressa talks about “drawing the line”.115 Do we consider the basis of our own moral stance? Do we reflect on the cir-cumstances in which we would stand up for fairness or against corruption? How do we balance the importance of engendering “smooth interpersonal relationships” against calling out misconduct? 116 To what extent would we compromise if we felt intimidated and feared for our own safety? To what extent do we tend to adopt unchallenged the social mores of our culture? Pondering such issues can help us to draw our own ‘line’.

Ressa explains that deciding where to draw the line has been a core underpinning of her stance against corruption and the misuse of power. Furthermore, as well as being effective, she feels that maintaining her personal moral integrity has been life affirm-ing and bestowed meaning to her life.

I learned that drawing the line, calling out unfairness and being honest … often means

moving life forward, bringing something new into fruition.117

Meaning is not something you stumble across or what someone gives you; you build it

through every choice you make, the commitments you choose, the people you love, and

the values you hold dear.118



The importance of taking care of ‘every step you take’119 is intrinsic to path dependence [15]. In one sense, path dependence is neutral; it does not of itself take a position on whether we should be moral or otherwise, but merely demonstrates that, collectively, what we believe and how that shapes what we do, is how the future is created. ‘But’, Ressa is saying, ‘if we want a reasonable crack at a future that is sustainable, fair and just, then it is the ‘moral means’ more than the ‘moral ends’ that matter’.120

Why bother having a law if you are not going to stick to it? If a democracy is to survive ...

the insidiousness of corruption, does that mean that lines have to be drawn every time,

that every cut against the truth has to be resisted? Ressa121



316 Section VIII On the Global



(c) Be authentic



The importance of being authentic is emphasised in particular by Havel. Havel points out that when regimes are founded on the suppression of dissent, or on the disallowing of a diversity of perspective, such regimes are in fact vulnerable, as they rely on power and terror to suppress opinion and hide or distort the actuality of what is happening. Such regimes are, says Rupert Read, based on lies,122 whereas, as Havel emphasises, “immense power … comes from telling the truth”.123

[They] may be struck at any moment … by the force of truth … it is a bacteriological

weapon. Havel124



Havel further suggests that when there is only a single accepted narrative or ideology, then, paradoxically, we citizens may look more widely and deeply at alternatives, or we may address more fundamental questions than we would have done if the political discourse were more complex and less coherent.

Havel’s key point is that many people, in the end, feel at odds with themselves if their authenticity is compromised. For instance, they may have to pretend that all is well when it is not, or feel it is dangerous to voice their views or express themselves through their actions and choices. Even when citizens cannot entirely point to the reason for their malaise, even when they are habituated to the dominant way of seeing things and its consequences, something does not feel right. As Havel says, their “authentic existence” is violated.125

Havel noticed that, as dissent grew in communist Czechoslovakia, individuals, in small ways, found they could no longer bear not to be themselves. He speaks of this phase as pre-political and describes how some focused on “self-education” and others on “free creative expression”.126 As he says: “There may be writers who [start to] write as they wish”, others who “practice independent scholarship” or “organise private discussions”. Dissenters may include “clergymen who try to carry on a free religious life” as well as “painters, musicians and singers”.127 “Young people”, he said, wanted no more than “to play the music they enjoyed, to live freely in dignity.”128

Iran has a long history of repressing dissent. But a movement [referring to the recent

surge of young women who want to be free to express themselves] that has no stated

goals and no leadership, but deep cultural roots, may be hard to control.129

Havel described how these almost unconscious but determined attempts at authentic-ity, which took place just out of view and were not mobilised or coordinated, provided the pre-political milieu for more deliberate resistance. He felt that “attempts at polit-ical reform were not the cause of society’s reawakening but rather the final outcome of that reawakening”.130 This diverse, personal expression, driven by the necessity of living one’s personal truth, and by a need to “regain control over one’s own sense of responsibility”, Havel saw as a moral act.131 Through being yourself, you “be the change you want to see in the world”.132

70 Who got the power? I got the power 317



(d) Encourage agonistic dissent



I now return to Chantal Mouffe and the concept of agonistic dissent. Mouffe’s critique is not aimed at those living under dictatorships but at the ideology of modern liber-alism. The core of her concern is that modern liberalism tries to stifle difference and antagonism in its struggle for consensus. Liberalism, she feels, does not regard antago-nism as a fundamental aspect of being human, as “constitutive of human societies”.133 Evidence suggests, as discussed in [65], that humans embody both a tendency towards competition and antagonism and a tendency towards compassion. Mouffe however is not suggesting we set out to create antagonistic political processes that are polaris-ing and breed conflict; these would work against robust but constructive debate. She leads us towards the notion of agonism – a way to surface and live with difference with-out it either going underground (and stifling debate, making it hard to challenge the status quo, and even harder for new social and political structures to emerge) or lead-ing to violence. She asserts that “acknowledging the ineradicability of the conflictual dimension in social life, far from undermining the democratic project, is the necessary condition to which democratic politics is confronted”.134 Far from seeing ‘the political’ as a space of power, conflict and antagonism, she says that liberal theorists, for exam-ple Hannah Arendt, envisage the political as a space of freedom and public delibera-tion, as a place where we can allow a multiplicity of perspectives and ‘structure in’ the opportunity to disagree and dialogue.



So, where does this take us?



A pause for breath: This has been one of the longest pieces in the book and has pulled together material from a wide range of sources and covered a lot of ground.

Exploring the writings of those who have experienced the impact of loss of democratic freedoms and can warn of the stealth with which such freedoms are eroded, highlights the threats and the opportunities we face. These writers describe the world in ways I recognise from complexity thinking. They emphasise path dependency and the lock-in of power; they clarify the conditions under which resilient societies sustain their resilience.

The notion of path dependency – that the future path is created one step at a time and builds on the steps already taken – arises again and again in these stories and writ-ings. It explains how power grows. But it also explains how ‘walking’ in accordance with one’s own moral compass, and in the truth of one’s own authenticity, has the capacity to ‘erode’ such power structures and eat them away from the inside.

The lessons learned – beware single-stream ideologies; inform yourself through mul-tiple diverse sources; speak truth to power; tackle early; embrace diversity of opinion and encourage debate – have wider application than to political systems alone. These lessons provide food for thought for any collective human endeavour. The idea, for ex-ample, that change comes because people feel ‘the lie’ occurs not only in dictatorships 318 Section VIII On the Global



but can also occur in situations where people are told that to be happy loyal citizens they must be good consumers and buy more. Or they are assured they have equality of opportunity, even though they feel dispossessed and helpless [65]. Populism is based, so Mouffe would say, on popular leaders connecting emotionally with these feelings of unfairness and dislocation and then providing a target – immigrants or unions or ‘the socialists’ – for people to blame.

I continue to be mesmerised by the way in which these writers, from very different times and worlds, see things in such similar ways. There is so much resonance with a processual view of the complex world and I find in these writings sources of inspiration as to how to act. Clearly, a worldview cannot, of itself, offer nuanced solutions honed through life’s experience, but experiences as described by these writers, that chime with and affirm a complexity worldview offers a powerful combination both to unravel concepts and inform action.

In the face of a polycrisis, what should we do?



Taking a global perspective through the lens of complexity emphasises limits to growth and

raises concerns about increasing inequality. It underlines the need for global governance,

the centrality of values in shaping behaviour, and the importance for each of us to play our

part in co-creating the future.



This in the last piece in this section ‘On the Global’ but it is also the ‘last piece’. I am submitting this manuscript in two days. Early this morning, I walked into my local town to the one coffee shop that opens at the crack of dawn. As I walked there, I found myself looking back over the last five years during which I have been working on this book. I asked myself: ‘If I had to summarise the key points in a few sentences, what would I say?’ Here are those sentences:

The social and natural world is complex whether we like it or not. The same under-

standing of the dynamics of complexity emerges time and again in very different tra-

ditions – from brain science, to Daoism, to the science of open systems. Hence under-

standing the nature of our complex world is worth the effort.

The triumvirate of mindsets, intentions and values shapes our behaviour more than

almost anything else and fashions the collective path that we take.

We are making the future; it is not just imposed on us. And our future is looking precar-

ious. The essential connectedness of everything means, first, that “no one is safe until

we are all safe”135 and second, I can’t just sit back, drink another coffee, and leave it all

to ‘them’.



Turning to the theme of this final section, ‘On the Global’, it is appropriate to ask on what basis I assert that the future looks precarious? March 2024 has been the hottest March yet, following a ten-month run of ‘hottest months to date’,136 and eight years of the hottest on record – yet we are still investing in fossil fuels and emissions are still rising. Increasing drought, flooding, extreme weather events and geopolitical conflicts are driving poverty, starvation and homelessness and rendering millions unsafe. Fear, fuelled by spiralling economic inequality, is causing rising xenophobia and its associat-ed politics. Food and energy security have become weapons of war. The word ‘polycri-sis’ – a cluster of crises that interact and reinforce and can impact every aspect of the future – has entered the common language.

Last night, I went to a book launch for Growth by Daniel Susskind,137 at which he challenged – indeed mocked – the view that never-ending growth is not possible on a finite planet.138 As will be obvious from the arguments developed earlier in this section, I disagree for three reasons:

First, to whatever degree innovation and technology lead to more productive use of resources, or create more imaginative services for us to buy, ‘stuff’ still lurks beneath. 320 Section VIII On the Global



The envelope of possibility can be extended through innovation, but it cannot be end-less. There is no ‘perpetual motion machine’.139

Secondly, the current growth trajectory is very ‘stuff’ intensive. For example, two-thirds of US adults are overweight or obese.140 One-third of the total projected global popu-lation is expected to be obese by 2025. Herein lies a wonderful business growth strate-gy: Get people to eat more than they need through providing addictive ultra-processed food which is difficult to resist. This has the added benefit that the pharmaceutical in-dustry then has a growing market of those suffering from the health impacts of obe-sity. The global obesity epidemic is predicted to cost $1.2 trillion annually by 2025.141 Meanwhile, 783 million people are chronically undernourished worldwide.142

My question is: How do we stop these corporations not merely benefitting from such trends – but, in the name of Growth and Profit, often pulling out all the stops to create them? Innovation in these industries may lead to lower unit costs but it is not directed at lowering volumes. It is one thing, as Susskind suggests, to say that we should shift the nature of growth away from ‘stuff’; it is another thing to persuade the ‘stuff ped-dlers’ to give up their ‘gravy trains’.



Fahrenheit 451

I am reminded of the dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, written in 1953.

In it he imagines a world where owning books becomes a criminal offence as reading

causes people to think and makes them unhappy. Instead, people are encouraged to

spend all their time watching ‘happy’ programmes on TV screens and commit any spare

cash to buying a screen for each wall.



Thirdly, as Susskind himself explains, the current growth trend is strongly correlated with widening inequalities. He confirmed that those who own the ‘capital’ are continu-ing to increase their share of the ‘wealth pie’ compared with the workers. And, more than that, there is widening inequality between the very rich owners and the less rich owners, just as there is between the high earners and those at the bottom of the earn-ings ladder. Susskind was not complacent about inequality, but he was adamant that it was not an issue to be left at the door of commerce; inequality, in his view, is not their problem.

My point is: I’m not convinced that the planet can offer unlimited resources howev-er much we improve their efficient use through innovation. I’m not convinced that current corporations, whose growth is very much predicated on ‘stuff’, are going to change their ways. And I can’t see any reason why the accelerating inequality will slow down on its own.

I draw on complexity theory to substantiate these statements. As I’ve explored throughout the book, complexity thinking emphasises the systemic nature of our world and the need for balance between its differing aspects if it is to maintain resilience and health. Humans are behaving like rogue rabbits and, like the rabbits, are quite capable of eating all the food and destroying their habitat at the same time. Self-regulation is

71 In the face of a polycrisis, what should we do? 321



not a given, and it is hard to see how unremitting economic growth can be sustained, however much it is ‘greened’ or ‘innovated’.

Equally, path dependence and lock-in explain how power inequalities tend to grow – as the powerful gain and maintain sufficient power to overwhelm their opponents, in both the economic and political spheres.

The hegemony of uncontrolled profit (a major cause of the ecological crisis) increases

inequalities within each nation and across the entire planet. The qualities of our civili-

zation have deteriorated, and its deficiencies have increased, notably in the spread of

selfishness and the disappearance of traditional solidarities. Edgar Morin143

Much infectious disease has its roots in ecological change. That means that the health

of the planet and the health of humans must be considered alongside that of animals.

It also means we should invest in public health as never before, stop cutting down the

forests, address climate change and phase out intensive farming. A ‘one health’ plane-

tary approach is the best hope we have. John Vidal144



So, what should we do?



It seems to me that the ‘what should we do’ question focuses on the need to find ways to push back against greed, spiralling inequality and growth. And this translates into asking the question: How to wrest the fragility of our future out of the hands of pow-erful elites who do not appear to feel responsible for our collective future? Typical of these are global corporations that often go unchallenged, except by their profit-orient-ed shareholders. Indeed, rather than be challenged, corporates may even be aided and abetted by politicians focused on their personal short-term political careers, and con-cerned not to do anything that might upset their sponsors. And, of course, we consum-ers are not innocent in this pact – it is our desire for ‘stuff’, our entrancement by a life of plenty – that is part of the current self-perpetuating economic model, with all its allure.

I think there are three related issues that need to be addressed. All three focus on how to return to economic balance and a fairer society, and how to stop us humans destroy-ing the planet.

These are: The need for global governance, the need for leveraging action and the need to attend to our values, our ‘moral sentiments’, to borrow the term from Adam Smith.145

(1) The need for global governance



We need to strengthen global governance. In part, this can and should arise through the function of independent, international institutions – but governance is also imple-mented through protest, consumer choice, freedom of speech, civil society, campaigns, journalism and so on. Governance is driven, too, through the will of us citizens to en-gage and to recognise our part in the problem. Unless we can rely on cooperation and 322 Section VIII On the Global



fairness to balance societies and economies – and history suggests we cannot – then there is a role for governance.

The institutions that have the most power to shape the future are the giant corpora-tions. But they have no mandate to preserve the future, and they have no global con-stituency to whom they are answerable. Particular countries can impose their laws locally but cannot control the global movement of profits or the tendency to shift manufacturing to regimes with the most favourable legislative climate, or the ability of global information companies to monetarise our personal data submerged in ‘data lakes’. Corporations, as we know, are instituted primarily to grow, to dominate their sectors and to increase profits for shareholders. Susskind argues that we should not ask corporations to take any moral responsibility; corporations should merely focus on growth at all costs and wait to be ‘governed’. His view is not untypical.

George Monbiot, in The Age of Consent,146 underlines the way giant corporations have enormous influence in the political as well as the economic sphere, a point also made by Susskind. Monbiot says:

The shift of power to the global sphere is the reason why almost every major politi-

cal party on earth now has the same policies. Their policies are pre-determined by the

banks and financial speculators, the corporations and the global institutions. At the

national level, there is democracy but no choice. At the global level, there is choice but

no democracy. The great question of our age is what the hell we intend to do about it.

He goes on:

We leave our future in the hands of these men of commerce “who have appointed

themselves to run the world”. 147

So, what can be done? How can such mega-giants be held to account, regulated or even challenged? Can we imagine effective global governance, and what would it look like? How can ‘we’ institute ways to tax the mobile rich, control the shipment of toxic waste, sustain the ban on landmines, prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and op-pose the destruction of forests that function as the lungs of the world? How can we call into question the maxim of growth at any cost?

It is not that the field of global governance is entirely barren. In 2015, the United Na-tions created seventeen sustainable development goals with the aim of “peace and prosperity for people and planet, now and into the future”.148 Bodies such as the UN, the World Health Organisation, and the European Court of Human Rights play a role. But power is accorded them via national governments and we are still waiting for these governments to see the seriousness of global issues such as the climate heating, and show themselves prepared to curb the free rein of the corporations. One positive ex-ample: The Sackler family has just been fined $6bn for their role in the opioid crisis which led to half a million deaths over ten years.149

71 In the face of a polycrisis, what should we do? 323



There is also a role in global governance for all of us as citizens. Indeed, it is heartening to find stories of citizens making an impact. The achievement of 2000 Swiss women who changed the law, which happened as I bring this book to a close, is a very import-ant step.



Is climate protection a human right?

In 2023, a group of 2000 women accused the Swiss government of violating their hu-

man rights through its failure to act on climate change. The case was heard in the Euro-

pean Court of Human Rights, the first time the court had heard such a case. They asked,

“is climate protection a human right”?150 In April 2024, it was announced they had won,

the first ever climate case victory in the European Court of Human Rights.151



We citizens are also consumers. Do we pay sufficient attention to where our products come from and in what we invest? Journalists, academics, activists and authors can share information, expose questionable practices and galvanise action. Civil societies, charities, and other relatively independent bodies can equally play their part in expos-ing, lobbying, and campaigning. We lose the freedom to speak out at our peril, and it is salutary to recognise the extent to which those ‘speaking truth to power’ or even just trying to report on conflicts and protests, place their lives in danger. But governance is part of our duty as citizens, and we need to stand against any creeping erosions of the right to protest.

Inequality demands oppression. The more concentrated wealth and power become,

the more those who challenge the rich and powerful must be hounded and crushed. In

other words, economic inequality is mirrored by inequality before the law. … The best

measure of the health of a political system is who gets prosecuted. Monbiot152

One final point: The owners of the capital, the shareholders, are also citizens. One of my colleagues wondered if the handful of people who are super-rich, and really could make a difference, might see the light and take action to change things. Indeed, at Da-vos in 2021, 102 members of the global super-rich, including Disney heiress Abigail Disney, did actually express the view that the current tax system is rigged in their fa-vour and that governments around the world should “tax the rich and tax us now”.153



(2) Leveraging crisis; taking action



The second issue concerning ‘what to do’ centres on the need for each of us to take ac-tion and shoulder responsibility. We are all in this together, we are all in the soup [24]. Complexity thinking emphasises that ‘small things can have big effects’. We may feel insignificant – but consider the possibility that it could be your actions and behaviours that make a difference. The world is often impacted by singular events or by the ac-tions of particular individuals. Maybe our comments to the woman sitting next to us 324 Section VIII On the Global



on the train really had an impact. Maybe she is in a position of influence and our words created the courage for her to make a stand? We shouldn’t allow feelings of insignifi-cance or impotence to let ourselves off the hook.

People do have power. The work of historians such as William Dalrymple, Vaclav Havel and Jared Diamond suggests that, in the end, when there is little left to lose, when dif-ficulties become catastrophes, people rise.

Will we have to wait for such a serious crisis that the need to act is unequivocal and there is nothing to lose, nothing to hold people back? Will we wait ‘until the bitter end’ or will we find ways to create change before it is too late?

Crisis is a liminal point; it can signify the last straw before collapse, but it can also mo-bilise action.

George Monbiot is interested in the idea of promoting social tipping. He suggests we should start by working with “pockets of resistance”, engaging with people who are starting to think differently. We should “preach to the choir” rather than start with the gainsayers. We should start, he says, by connecting with people who think like us and then aim to “push out the concentric circles”.154

Individual action can engender change. For example, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, has had a significant impact on many.155 It was the campaigning by sub-poster master Alan Bates that led to a recent docudrama that exposed the failure of the UK government, over twenty years, to compensate Post Office managers for wrongful conviction for fraud following a computer error.156 The film so enraged the public that the government took action virtually overnight, after years of prevarica-tion. Writing, both fiction and non-fiction, and art in general, can inform, change opin-ions and beliefs, and create the impetus to stop us sitting on the sidelines. Activism takes many forms.



(2) The importance of values



The third issue I want to raise is the importance of our values. What we value, both indi-vidually and collectively, drives the future. The future is co-created one step at a time. We can’t control the future, but we can give it shape. What steps are we going to take in this creation of the path to the future? Do we value others, do we value nature, do we value fairness and truth – or are we more intent on greedily satisfying our own desires?

I find myself returning time and again to this theme of values. It is inescapable that the collective path of the future is shaped by what we, individually and collectively, do on the way. What we do matters – and what we value shapes what we do.

Edgar Morin, a French philosopher with an interest in complexity thinking, is now 102. His perspective comes from witnessing the whole of the last century. He has this to say:

71 In the face of a polycrisis, what should we do? 325



We are heading towards a probable catastrophe. The polycrisis we are experiencing

across the planet is an anthropological crisis: It is the crisis of humanity failing to be-

come Humanity.157



Morin’s view is that we need to return to our humanity, to the values of “fellowship, life and love”. He suggests we should see this as political resistance akin to the resistance movements that he would have experienced during the Second World War – resis-tance against the forces of “dislocation, disintegration, conflict and death”. This, too, is the message embedded in the work of Havel, Ressi and Temelkuran [70].

Morin again:158

The first and fundamental resistance is that of the spirit. It requires resisting the intim-

idation of every lie asserted as truth, the contagion of every collective intoxication. It

requires never yielding to the delirium of the collective [hegemony] of a people or an

ethnicity. It demands resisting hatred and contempt.



A sobering thought



Some thinkers are talking not just of a polycrisis but of a metacrisis. Jonathan Row-son describes this as “the crisis within and between all the world’s major crises” – an emerging systemic outcome that becomes ever more impossible to counter. He sees the root cause as a “multi-faceted delusion … that … manifests institutionally and cul-turally to the detriment of life on earth”.159 These are strong words. They endorse the theme of this book: the need to rethink our fundamental beliefs and worldviews. We cannot just tinker around the edges.

Our current ‘deluded’ way of life may indeed just implode. Both history and complexity remind us that the present will not last forever. It is sobering when listening to discus-sions of past empires on William Dalrymple’s podcast Empire,160 to find that I am hardly aware of some of the empires that ruled vast swathes of territory for centuries, such as the Persian Empire in the fifth century B.C.E. or the Mughal Empire in the seventeenth century. And, as discussed earlier [67], collapse is made more likely by inequality, limits to resources and breakdown of mutuality. We are getting perilously close to the point at which at least some aspects of our current social and natural world could descend into chaos, if they are not already doing so. We have to face that possibility and consid-er how to behave in the face of that possibility – both how to ward against it and how to act if things unravel.

In particular, orthodox economic thinking has, surely, to be addressed. There are many academic challenges to economic orthodoxy, not least from students.161 In contrast, politicians worldwide, from the left and right, seem reluctant to face this elephant in the room. We need, don’t we, a new way to ‘do’ economics that does not rely so fun-damentally on growth and does not lead so inexorably to widening inequality.162 Clive Hamilton tells us of an essay, written in 1939, by John Maynard Keynes, considering 326 Section VIII On the Global



what life would be like after another century of economic growth. Keynes imagined people would be choosing “wisely and agreeably and well” and would be cultivating the art of life and not selling themselves for the “means of life”. Hamilton asks: “Is it possible to imagine a society … in which we are no longer obsessed with growth and consumption and instead cultivate the art of life?”163

Which brings me back to the driving force behind this book: I have set out to put ‘flesh on the bones’ of a processual complex worldview and evidence my conviction that it provides a better fit with, a better explanation of, the world we see around us than does the mechanical view of classical science. As I say in the Introduction, my motivation comes from the desire to challenge both the orthodoxy and the hegemony of our cur-rent worldview. The ontology of process complexity provides a frame through which to understand change and stasis, unpick what engenders resilience, make sense of lock-in, reflect on the nature of emergence and consider the importance of our moral stance; through this, we may become clearer as to how, in Daoist language, to ‘cultivate’ our-selves, and how best to act. We need to challenge how we think, what we value, how we relate to each other, and how we treat the natural world.

The idea of metacrisis … draws attention to interiority (meta as within) and relational-

ity (meta as between) as spiritual features of what is typically assumed to be a political

challenge. Jonathan Rowson164



A call for action



For we have to act. We have to ask ourselves what part we are going to play as we face these challenging times. I am reminded of The Plague, a novel by Albert Camus,165 in which he tells an allegorical story of a town cut off from the outside world due to an outbreak of the plague. He describes how various citizens behave – some selfishly hoarding food, others carousing in the belief that there was no hope. But one charac-ter, the doctor, who understands more than anyone what might be in store, continues to work tirelessly to help the sick. Clive Hamilton, described this as active fatalism: “Despair, Accept and then Act … only by acting, and acting ethically, can we redeem our humanity”.166

This final section, then, presents a call for action – difficult, courageous, contentious action. It is a call to find our moral compass, face what is happening in the world, show up and play our part. It is a call to nurture our humanity, value life, value others, value the future and stay true. We must embrace our agency, however tiny that might feel. We are all complicit in co-creating the future.

Science and indeterminism



How science, when applied to ‘real world’ problems, is not suggesting things unfold

according to universal laws.



It seems a contradiction to allow that most physics theories are deterministic – can predict the future – and yet argue that the universe, even when looking at it through

the eyes of classical physics, is not. Even physics, that bastion of reason and objective ‘truth’– when you put all aspects together and apply it to ‘real world’ situations – does not suggest that the universe merely unfolds in an orderly fashion. In practice, its unique features depend on messiness, history and context.

In this piece I explore various reasons why this is so. My motivation comes from the concern that we seem as inclined as ever to conflate an aim to be scientific and profes-sional – when ‘managing’ the social world – with the adoption of machine-like assump-tions of predictability, certainty and objectivity. And we look to the ‘hard sciences’ to justify this approach [3].

During the Renaissance and long after, the ideas of omniscience and omnipotence

were closely linked. Ilya Prigogine1

Our science is based on the principle of causality, and causality is considered to be

an axiomatic truth. [In nature] every process is partially or totally interfered with by

chance, so much so that under natural circumstances, a course of events absolutely

conforming to specific laws is almost an exception. Carl Jung2

The soundbite is: ‘Even physics does not support a machine worldview; even physics does not regard things as working like clockwork; Pierre-Simon Laplace’s Daemon3 was retired many years ago.’

Science is popularly believed to be the story of unfiltered access to Nature as it really is.

… resting at a prestigious remove from the tangle of subjectivity, as an objective world

of Facts. … Science is a superior … value-free practice. Ahistorical, neutral, stoic and

foundational. Bayo Akomolafe4



But surely physics is deterministic?



Science, according to popular parlance, is about certainty, prediction and objective truth. This view of science paints a picture of a universe that works like a machine – a universe that seems real, unambiguous and independent of our (or anything else’s) view of it, with mechanisms definable and unchanging. If we know the starting point of this machine-like universe, we believe we can know everything that will ever happen – because things progress, so it would seem, in accordance with fixed laws. This idea – 330 Appendix



that the future is already decreed and defined and merely unfolds – is known as de-terminism. But is science really suggesting that this is the case, that the universe really works in this deterministic way? Or is there more to it than that?

The picture from science is, at first glance, straightforward. If you look independently at individual science theories – such as electromagnetism or sound or gravity – then, in the way they are defined, they are universal and deterministic. The behaviour of light and sound, or the effect of gravity, are all described by laws that are fixed and univer-sal, and we do expect these laws to apply everywhere and to remain stable. They are based on equations which, if the starting point and the boundaries of the problem are known, do give exact answers and, in principle, do define how situations unfold over time. Einstein’s theories of gravity are similarly deterministic, if a bit more complicated than Newton’s original version.5

In very many ways, we can have much confidence in these equations. There are many examples where these equations do indeed lead to predictable outcomes, ones that can be investigated and evidenced. For example, Einstein predicted a ‘gravitational redshift’ in light as it leaves a star’s gravitational field. This was measured by Thomas Eddington in 1919 on the island of Principe, during a solar eclipse, and it was precisely in line with Einstein’s prediction.6 Another example: Penrose reports that “Astrono-mers have been monitoring the orbits of one double neutron star system – known as PSR 1913+16 – for around 40 years; there has been an agreement between the signals received from space and the overall predictions of Einstein’s theory to an astonishing 14 decimal places.”7

But, is this precision the whole story? Is there indeed an objective deterministic uni-verse out there, obeying unchanging universal laws? Are we doomed to live, as William James called it, in “an iron block, with no equivocation or shadow of turning”?8

In fact, this perfect – or terrifying – picture does not play out in practice, and this is for several reasons. In the following short sections I explore seven of these reasons, and then consider the implications.

(a) Even if things can be described mathematically, it doesn’t mean things

are certain



Physics theories, on the whole, are based on mathematics, and some argue that the universe really does accord with mathematics. But even if this were the case, mathe-matics does not necessarily lead to certainty. Penrose gives an example, nick-named the hairy dog theorem.9 He shows that it is never possible to brush the hair of the no-tional dog flat everywhere; there is always one point where it will stick up, although we cannot predict where. The hairy dog theorem is unusual, but there are many equations that have more than one solution, even simple ones such as x2 = 1.

One important historical example is the three-body problem.10 The three-body prob-lem is an idealised situation in which the initial positions and velocities of three bodies, represented as points in space, are defined, and their subsequent behaviour investi-

72 Science and indeterminism 331



gated. The application of the three-body problem at the time of Newton was to explore the movement, due to gravity, of the sun, moon and earth in relation to each other. Even though this problem is simple to define, it has no simple solution. It cannot be solved analytically (i.e., on a piece of paper, solving equations by hand). It requires a numerical11 approach to home in on the possible trajectories and it shows that each trajectory is very sensitively dependent on the initial conditions.

The point to take from these examples is that even if the universe could be described en-tirely by mathematics, this would not necessarily translate into certainty. And whether the universe as a whole can be described mathematically is questionable. Many factors transpire to mess this up, not least thermodynamics, as I will discuss later.

(b) Classical simplifications



When the maths of classical physics was developed in the seventeenth to the nine-teenth centuries, there were many simplifying assumptions. For example, Newton’s mathematics, which described the solar system, treated each planet as if it were a point. Newton also ignored any interactions between the planets and focused on their independent interaction with the sun. Another example: The theory of thermodynam-ics assumed that each collision between molecules was independent of every other collision.

Newton’s physics gives us a picture of a perfect machine; thermodynamics yields an image of a steady flow towards minimum energy. These seem contradictory and I re-member as a teenager studying physics and wondering when you apply one and when you apply the other. The first applies to situations in which there are only a small num-ber of things interacting with forces, and every movement can be tracked. The sec-ond applies to gases or liquids with trillions of seemingly identical particles, and you can look statistically at the whole. But when does the number of particles become big enough to move from mechanics to thermodynamics, I wondered to myself? There is not really an answer to this question, as these are mathematical idealisations which allowed the physicists of the classical era to make huge progress. The real world has more complexity than these analytical simplifications can capture.

Even if we can have confidence in physical laws, applying them to real-life situations opens up a number of contextual issues, and these add complexity, as the next sections will show.

(c) Beginnings, endings, singularities and discontinuities



In ‘The ticking clock’ [3], I touched on the problems of beginnings and endings and how Newton dealt with these by bringing God into the picture. Physics theories such as gravity or electromagnetism cannot easily be extended to deal with discontinuities or singularities – such as what happens at or before the beginning of the universe, or in a black hole, or at its end.12

332 Appendix



We can understand the universe back to the first microsecond … when it was just the

size of a tennis ball. As yet we have no experimental foothold on the very extreme phys-

ics involved [before that]. Martin Rees13



Beginnings and endings are one form of singularity. In mathematical terms, a singu-larity is where solutions to equations go to infinity or, colloquially, ‘blow up’. Another example is a gravitational singularity, in which gravity becomes so intense that space itself breaks down. At a singularity, the ‘normal’ laws of physics cannot be applied, and, as Penrose explains, “space and time end”.14 Singularities create discontinuities, analo-gous to ‘tears in the fabric’ or ‘sinkholes in the landscape’.

To talk about the age of the universe is already in a sense a non-Einsteinian con-

cept because the age of the universe only has sense if the birth of the universe is an

event, something irreversible, and that [event] does not form part of Einstein’s theory.

Prigogine15



Just to complicate things further, when you include quantum mechanics in the consid-eration of the centre of black holes, these black holes may end up technically not being ‘singularities’; however, they still remain ‘discontinuities’ where what emerges may be different in kind to what was there before.16

(d) Boundaries



Beginnings and endings are one sort of boundary, but there are also spatial bound-aries.17 It may not be an obvious point, but the classical laws of physics were derived for closed systems. A closed system is one which does not allow, inside the situation of interest, any energy, information or matter to leave or penetrate from ‘outside’. The total amount of energy, matter or electric charge is conserved in such isolated closed systems. It may make sense to consider the universe as a closed system (although this is itself contentious), but when considering more local situations – from galaxies to ponds – these are inevitably open to their environments, to their wider contexts. For example, stars emit light which leaves the galaxy in which they are situated, and stray asteroids wander their way in. And ponds are wonderful examples of open systems – they receive light and heat from the sun, they are subject to winds and rain, animals come and go, birds drop seeds and people drop litter.

To have open boundaries necessarily causes there to be a level of uncertainty about what is going on. We cannot be sure what might invade or leave through these open boundaries. The laws of physics still apply, but to gain certainty we would need to know everything that crossed those boundaries. Embracing the inevitability of open boundaries and the consequent implications, is a key aspect of complexity theory, as discussed in [8] and [11].



72 Science and indeterminism 333



If we think about the whole universe, we might argue that, as the universe must include everything, it must be a closed system. But this returns us to the point raised in ‘The ticking clock’ [3] – closed with respect to what? We could equally argue the universe is open. We can only decide whether it is open or closed in relation to something outside of it.

(e) Integration of forces in physics



Next, there is the issue of the integration of the differing forces in physics. The hunt for a so-called unified field theory has been the goal of physics since at least 1914 and it still eludes us. Although some physicists believe that, in the end, all the bits will tie up and we will have a ‘theory of everything’, there are many, including Roger Penrose, Martin Rees, and Carlo Rovelli, who think this is unlikely.

To make it even more complicated, the physical forces, particularly when venturing into the quantum domain, are not, in general, additive, but interact with each other. Their affects are synergistic; that is to say that the outcome of two or more different forces or fields cannot in general be reduced to the addition of their separate impacts, calculated separately.18

(f) Messy real-world situations



Even when the forces of physics are individually deterministic and well understood, they are operating on messy non-uniform situations in the ‘real world’.19 Indeed, in or-der to get the ‘clumping’ of gas and energy that leads to star formation, the starting clouds of ‘stuff’ have to be non-uniform. Stars are created from turbulence and vortices in clouds of simple molecules. Some clumped patches of these swirling clouds need to be dense enough for gravity to be able to amass enough force for nuclear reactions to be initiated.

In addition, these clouds tend to be strongly magnetic; magnetism resists gravity, hence more material is needed before there is a collapse into star formation, and this interplay allows the resulting star to be bigger than if the clouds were not magnetic. The particularity of the shape and size of a molecular cloud, and the exact timing of other matter arriving from the wider universe, will shape what sort of star is formed. And when there are births and explosions leading to the formation of new heavier el-ements, these events are complex and what happens is very dependent on context. Scientists have an understanding of the conditions under which stars can form – but knowing to where a particular situation might lead is another matter.

Why did [the universe] have the kind of irregularities that resulted in it not remaining a

uniform gas, but developing clusters of galaxies? Martin Rees20



334 Appendix



(g) Messiness and heat



‘Messiness’ is a particular feature of the theory of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics deals with the energetic movement of particles in gases and liquids, and it is this move-ment that leads to heat. The more energy the particles have, the more they bump into each other, and the hotter the liquid or gas becomes. It is a statistical theory, yet, for closed systems, the progression, on average, from hot to cool, follows a well-defined path. Over time, such an isolated system will run down, become featureless, and find its lowest energy state, known as heat death.21 This is described by the second law of thermodynamics.22

But although the ‘average’ trajectory towards heat death can be described by equa-tions which are deterministic – in the sense that, on average, it moves predictably and inexorably towards its lowest energy state – there are wobbles on the way. A bit like bringing soup to a boil, the process is not smooth – there are places which get hotter first and bubble up, and other areas will bubble up later. In general, the timing and na-ture and sequence of the ‘bubbles’ of emerging patterns that occur along the way is salient to what happens, and then what happens next. For example, if – just at the point that the interstellar ‘soup’ gave forth a bubble – a meteor shower arrived, then the out-come would be different than if the meteor shower arrived later or earlier. Classical methods of statistics ignore the history of the interaction between things; they assume that each event has no trace of previous events (there is no memory or hysteresis) and that something only interacts with one other thing at a time.

The point is that the particularity of what happens drives the particularity of what happens next. Messiness matters and its particular nature shapes the future. There are more sophisticated forms of statistics that embrace ‘possibility’ rather than ‘prob-ability’, but I won’t go further here [62].23

I look at thermodynamics of open systems and the way it formed the basis for complex-ity theory in [8].



Epistemological versus ontological indeterminism



This has been a very brief waltz through the sources of indeterminism in the universe. I have been intent on trying to illustrate that – even if at some future point, we man-age to connect up physics theories and create a unified field theory and even if we are able to push back our understandings to the beginning or even before the beginnings of the big bang or big bangs – there are sources of indeterminism that do not go away. Indeed, non-uniformity, fluctuations, and general messiness are not only inevitable but necessary conditions to enable clouds of ‘stuff’ to ‘clump’. It is this clumping that allows stars and galaxies to form; furthermore, each galaxy, star, asteroid and dust cloud is distinct. Such messy real-world situations are particular to their history and context and are complex.

72 Science and indeterminism 335



At risk of confusing matters, I want to add another nuance to this discussion on in-determinism and introduce the difference between indeterminism that is associated with our ways of knowing (epistemological in origin) and indeterminism that is intrinsic to the nature of things (ontological in origin).

Epistemological



Just because it is difficult to track everything, this still does not necessarily mean that the universe is not knowable in principle. Laplace gave substance to this idea when he dreamed up the thought experiment of a Daemon sitting out there in the universe, a Daemon who had a big enough brain so he could track everything. In principle, if the Daemon knew the starting point, at the beginning (if there was a beginning) of time, of every bit of energy or information or matter – however messy and non-uniform – together with “all the forces by which nature is animated,”24 he could work out how things would unfold.

But we – or any other entity in the universe – are not that Daemon! There is uncertain-ty caused by ignorance. This sort of uncertainty which is due to the practical limitations of knowing is called epistemological indeterminism. That is to say that the universe is so complicated that it is impossible to know in practice the movement of every mole-cule, every spark of energy, every dust cloud. The universe is not deterministic in any meaningful way.

Determinism is saved in principle, but it is inoperative since one cannot know exhaus-

tively the initial states. Edgar Morin25



Ontological



In fact, we can go further. Quantum physics confronts us with the idea of ontological indeterminism, a profound indeterminism that is intrinsic to its nature. I explore quan-tum physics and ontological indeterminism in [73].



In summary



So, to summarise, there are several reasons, coupled together – discontinuities, bound-aries, interplay between forces in ‘real world’ situations, intrinsic uncertainties due to the particularities of messiness and variations – that show how the universe, even if we only focus on its material nature, is really not the predictable machine that some might think science believes it to be.26 It all adds up to a view of the universe that is much more particular and contextual, and a universe in which novelty can emerge. As Leibniz said at the time, Newton’s laws cannot tell us why the planets and galaxies are where they are, and why there is such diversity of form in the world of galaxies and planets. We cannot know when and where a star will be formed, how big it will be and 336 Appendix



how long it will survive; we cannot predict the particularity of structures. And these fluctuations, interactions and uncertainties in the ‘real world’ are necessary for the uni-verse to emerge and evolve. They are not just incidental.

Darwin, in his thinking about evolution, similarly realised messiness, variation, and fluctuations are a necessary condition for the emergence of new forms [7]. Cosmologist Lee Smolin, in fact, suggests that evolution is the primary process not just for the living world but for the universe as a whole.27

In this piece, I have limited my arguments to the world of classical physics. But, as I’ve hinted, if you include quantum physics, you start to toy with the idea of intrinsic or ontological indeterminism – something more baked in and fundamental – and I will ex-plore this next in [73].

ophy. Hamlet



A summary



I think this piece is the most dense of anything I have written in this book. I am trying to articulate what quantum physics is, what it has to say about the nature of the uni-

verse, and what that infers about the way we think about ‘reality’. Only read this in the morning with a cup of coffee and feel free to skip.

To summarise the key points in a few sentences:

The universe dissolves, at its smallest scales, into paradox; its properties are held in

relationship between ‘things’, not in the things themselves. Quantum physics offers a

relational, subjective and contextual view of ‘reality’. These are ontological, intrinsic

qualities. Quantum physics opens the door to ‘mystery’.



Introduction



Quantum physics changes the game. It causes us to conjure with concepts such as ‘on-tological paradox’ and ‘ontological indeterminism’. It forms a basis for a relational view of the universe and something I have called ‘ontological subjectivity’, which I go on to discuss. In these few pages, I want to give at least a hint of the implications of this the-ory, a theory which provides many verifiable outcomes and has stood the test of time.

This short piece contains a number of terms particular to quantum physics and, rath-er than try to define them all, I am leaving it to the reader to look up any terms that are unfamiliar (terms such as entanglement and action at a distance). I am trying to convey a sense of what this all implies rather than try to pin it down entirely. As Richard Feynman said “I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics”.

There are many interpretations of quantum physics, some of which still persist in the social sciences, even when they are no longer current in the physical sciences.28 I am basing my arguments primarily on the work of Carlo Rovelli, Roger Penrose and Chris Clarke.29

338 Appendix



What I am aiming to illustrate here is that quantum physics provides a concept of uncertainty or indeterminism that is more than epistemological in nature; is not just about ‘limits to knowing’ but seems to be ‘baked in’ to the way things are – an intrinsic, ontological sort of uncertainty. The nature of this uncertainty is not straightforward, though, as I will go on to show. And it goes beyond the much-talked-about uncertainty principle.30 In fact, the uncertainty principle – which defines the relationship between position and momentum, or between energy and time – is very specific in defining the way in which these so-called complementary pairs are connected. So, the uncertainty principle, peculiarly, is actually very exact.

Quantum physics is made even more difficult to grasp for the non-specialist as it pro-vides a rich source of metaphor and it can be tricky to distinguish the science of quan-tum physics applied in its realm from the metaphorical use of its concepts – of, for ex-ample, entanglement, action at a distance, or paradoxical cats in boxes. It is hazardous to assume that quantum physics concepts can map directly onto the experience of or-dinary life, for reasons I will explain.



Two parts to quantum physics: coherence and decoherence



I want to start by bringing attention to two contrasting aspects of quantum physics. They are both necessary aspects of the theory. First, there is the coherent, determin-istic part which can be expressed by a deterministic mathematical equation, such as Schrödinger’s equation. Such equations are relevant in situations where they are de-scribing a ‘pure’ quantum state in isolation from – and not interacting with – anything else. Second, there is the process of decoherence or ‘collapse’ where there is interaction, and something irreversible and unpredictable happens.

The coherent part



One of the representations of quantum physics is via a wave function – an abstract mathematical probability function that captures the information about possible out-comes. The wave function does not exist in any tangible sense and yet it leads to test-able predictions. The wave function is described as coherent, where “all parts of it have phases that are in step”.31

Although the wave function is capturing probabilities, it remains deterministic in the sense that what those probabilities are, and how they unfold, can be well-defined. However, these probabilities do not cover up our ignorance, as in classical physics; they are somehow intrinsic to nature.

To say that probability is intrinsic to the nature of things is of fundamental importance. It brings into question whether there really is an incontrovertibly existent universe. Do we have to change our concept of existence or of reality? Is there a way in which two incompatible things can both be true? This is illustrated by means of a thought experiment, nicknamed Schrödinger’s cat, which considers a notional ‘cat in a box’ and questions whether the cat is alive or dead.32 The probability embedded in the quantum

73 Smoke and mirrors: the paradox of quantum physics 339



wave function not saying: ‘The cat is alive or dead, we just don’t yet know which.’ It is saying that the cat, in some sense, is both alive and dead.

Putting the cat aside for a moment, the idea of a quantum probability function can at first glance seem unremarkable. But, as Rovelli tells us, it hides much that is bizarre. In ideal conditions, whereby photons, let’s say, are not being interacted with and remain in a ‘pure’ coherent state, they display behaviours that just do not make sense to our everyday experience, such as ‘action at a distance.’33 These behaviours derive from the ‘quantum interference’34 between distinct states within the wave function. For exam-ple, one state might be ‘spin up’ and the other ‘spin down’ – analogous to the cat being alive and dead. Rovelli describes, in Helgoland, an experiment with laser beams to il-lustrate this.35 I won’t try to describe it here, but it demonstrates that the concept of a universe made of ‘things’ interacting – even if those things are more like waves, more dispersed than the way we commonly tend to envisage things – is just not so. What is a ‘thing’ is paradoxical not because it is hard to measure, but because that is its nature. It is an ontological paradox. At the quantum level there is no ‘thing’ at all.

The decoherent part



Moving on to the second aspect of quantum physics, its process of decoherence, we ask what happens when these wave functions do interact with other ‘things’, for exam-ple with “heat vibrations.”36 In these situations, the coherence in the wave function is lost and something definite, ‘actual’ and irreversible occurs. In other words, the mess-iness of the real world causes the quantum probability waves to collapse or decohere and we return to the behaviour of the classical world.

This decohering process is often attributed to ‘the role of the observer’, and this can give a whole anthropocentric feel to the implications. It is the case that this decoher-ence can and will result from human measurement as in Rovelli’s example described above. But this process is not only attributable to human involvement. Quantum me-chanics operates perfectly well out there in the heavens, and operated before we came into existence. As Rovelli says, “to think that human beings, their minds, their tools or the numbers they use play any special role in the [ontological] grammar of nature is nonsense”.37

The equivalent process of ‘observation’ in deepest space, is when, let’s say, a quan-tum state interacts with a gravitational fluctuation. Penrose suggests this process is particularly relevant in a black hole, where conditions are so dense that gravitational fluctuations are at the same scale as quantum states. The outcome will depend on the interplay between gravity and quantum effects, and, in the words of Penrose, it is as if the universe “makes a choice” between options.38

Cohering and decohering



The characteristics of the quantum world emerge through the interplay of both as-pects of the theory. Pure coherent quantum states are ‘collapsed’ by interaction and 340 Appendix



relationship. The language and description of these two aspects will continue to evolve and continue to provide a source of mystery and potential.



A further look at coherent states: the importance of context

and relationship



I want to mention one more aspect of coherent states, which emphasises the impor-tance of context and relationship. Rovelli and Clarke introduce the idea of “context-de-pendent logic.”39 Clarke explains that this means that “two opposites can both be true – but not in the same context”40 and thus “reality depends on the context.”41 To put it another way, what manifests depends on the relationship between two (or more) par-ticular quantum functions. It is a relational outcome of that particular interaction in a particular situation. Rovelli says, in Helgoland, “we cannot separate the properties of the objects from the objects interacting with them in order for these properties to be manifested in the first place. … This is contextuality; things exist in a context”.42

I will attempt an example: Imagine you have three coherent quantum wave functions, A, B and C. A contains the quantum equivalent of the superposition of the dead cat and the live cat. When B interacts with A, the upshot is that the cat shows as alive. When C interacts with A, the upshot is that the cat shows as dead. Both are ‘true’ but manifest in different contexts. Or, to put it more graphically, the cat may be dead to you and alive to me.43

It is a world of perspectives, of manifestations, not of entities with definite properties

or unique facts. Properties do not reside in objects; they are bridges between objects.

Rovelli44



This idea of the universe as essentially manifesting in relationship is a very profound shift indeed.



Quantum fluctuations



There is one final point to introduce, which is on the subject of fluctuations. It seems that quantum fluctuations can pop up out of nothingness. Penrose suggests that this may lead to another universe being born when this one has run out of energy, or that many ‘baby’ universes can emerge out of black holes. It is also thought that this random process contributed to the lack of symmetry at the big bang (or bangs). As I discuss in [72], there needs to be some asymmetry, some messiness, for things to be able to clump together and form the stars and galaxies that evolved. Otherwise, all you get is a uniform expanding featureless cloud. As Clarke says, part of the messiness is due to these quantum fluctuations, arising in the initial cosmic fireball, which can “gave rise to the galaxies that would not otherwise have appeared”.45

73 Smoke and mirrors: the paradox of quantum physics 341



Making some sense of all this



I have been in two minds as to whether to include this piece on quantum mechanics. Let me try to summarise the key points I am endeavouring to demonstrate.

Ontological indeterminism



Quantum effects contribute to a fundamental source of indeterminism at the very tini-est scales of the universe. Rovelli asks: “Are we convinced that the world is determinis-tic, that the future and the past are univocally determined by the world’s present? Can we really squeeze the discoveries of quantum physics into the canons of metaphysical prejudice?”46 By metaphysical prejudice, he means, in this case, our fervent desire for a deterministic world.

Quantum physics conveys an intrinsic indeterminism in the ‘essence’ of the universe – an ontological indeterminism that is immanent, ‘baked in’.

One of the sources of ontological indeterminism embedded in the quantum world re-sults from the fact that quantum fluctuations can bubble up out of nowhere in random fashion, as noted above.

A second source of indeterminism occurs when there is a decoherent interaction, as we cannot be sure which, of all the possibilities, will actually occur.

The third reason for indeterminism comes from the paradox of ‘context-dependent logic’ mentioned above. Contradictory things may be true at the same time, but in dif-ferent contexts.

Paradox, relationships and ontological subjectivity



This idea that two contradictory things can both be occurring at the same time is a really profound thought. It suggests that paradox is woven into the universe, and that this paradox is ontological in origin.

This point about the paradox of context-dependent logic takes us into the territory of what I am calling ontological subjectivity. What is happening depends on the perspec-tive of those aspects of the cosmos that are interacting. The universe is not made up of things connected together in ways that make it possible precisely to define the present or precisely to predict the future; it cannot be understood as “a set of causal interac-tions ultimately reducible to matter and motion”.47 Just in the way that I have a subjec-tive view of my dog, a view that says as much about me as it does about the dog, then this gravitational fluctuation ‘sees’ that quantum fluctuation in a particular way and another gravitational fluctuation ‘sees’ it in a different way. The properties exist in the relationship between ‘things’ not in the things themselves.

As a fundamental underpinning of ‘reality’ these ideas are, I think, mind-boggling, al-most impossible to grasp entirely with the reasoning mind, as they move us beyond the sort of reason we are used to. But they do illustrate that the universe is not ‘real’ in the 342 Appendix



sense we imagine and not even Laplace’s Daemon could be sure of what is there and what might happen next.

In a relational world, the properties of things are not fixed absolutely … they arise

instead from the interactions and relationships among the things in the world. Lee

Smolin48

I mean to conjure a world that is not at all composed of ‘things’ already possessing

properties and features but a maelstrom of relationships in open-ended becomings.

Bayo Akomolafe49



Finally, mystery



I want to take one further step: Perhaps we can even say that the universe is mysteri-ous to itself, in an immanent way, imbued in its very fabric.50 John Kay and Mervyn King ask: “Does our world contain mysteries or puzzles?” Puzzles are solvable, mysteries are not.

This idea of mystery is given particular articulation by Chris Clarke.51 Quantum phys-ics, he felt, re-integrates the scientific with the mystical and the mysterious. If religion or spirituality is in part based on belief in this mystical quality, then quantum physics can be said to re-integrate science and spirituality.

The crack of complementarity left open what actually came into existence as a re-

sult of a quantum process, what actually becomes …. this emergence, this mystery.

Chris Clarke52



Maybe our sixth sense – our reaction to the atmosphere of an old church, a premoni-tion of danger, the synchronicities that sometimes seem to occur – are examples of feeling into the numinous aspects of existence that reach beyond reason. There are many examples of other living creatures – plants, animals, slime moulds – that seem to have incredible abilities to apprehend the intangible. Maybe we are sensing into those aspects of the ‘way things are’ that hide within quantum physics?



Summary



The key takeaway from this piece is that quantum physics changes the game in many ways: it questions the nature of reality, it introduces an ontological form of indetermin-ism, and it opens the door for mystery, for the reintegration of science and ‘spirituality’



73 Smoke and mirrors: the paradox of quantum physics 343



and a return to natural philosophy. If this has whetted your appetite, I recommend in particular the work of Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin.



A word of warning



A word of warning, though: It is always dangerous to assert anything about quantum physics as quantum physicists themselves do not all agree. And, of course, quantum physics will not be the last word; other theories will follow, which will include and tran-scend, or indeed disavow it. Indeed, the field of quantum gravity, where scientists are grappling with the interplay between the quantal and gravitational world, is surfacing yet new metaphysical insights. So, there is no need to take my word for it, but I hope at least it unsettles, if not unseats, any notions of what is real.

11 Ontology contains not only the concepts of the ‘nature of being’ but also includes the possibility that things are always changing, so it inevitably must address the ‘nature of change’. 12 The word ontology is also sometimes applied to more specific situations e.g. what is our ontology of the nature of organisations – i.e. what image do we hold in our heads of what an organisation is. 13 Freya Mathews (2008), for example, writes wonderfully about the importance of metaphysics in Metaphysics: A Once and Future Discourse.

91 Mechanical systems tend to be conceived as a relatively small number of ‘things’ connected by forces. Thermodynamic systems consist of very many things (like molecules in a gas) which bump into each other and are described statistically. I remember asking myself as a teenager, studying physics at school, when we regard the few as becoming the many. There is no definite answer to this question, as these are idealisations.

92 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BelousovZhabotinsky_reaction 93 Order out of Chaos is the title of one of Prigogine’s books (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984). 94 Hargittai, I. (2003). Candid Science III: More Conversations with Famous Chemists (M. Hargittai, Ed.). Imperial College Press.

95 Physicists note that for situations to be discernible, there have to be some distinguishing features – and this requires a degree of order! If the world were either completely featureless, like a flat plane, or completely random (like a gas cloud in steady state) there is no way of distinguishing one place from another, or one thing from another. Entropy is a measure of the ‘information’ in the system and this is associated with order.

96 This difference between classical statistics and methods that look at possibilities not just probabil-ities is explained in more detail in chapter 5 of Embracing Complexity (2015). I also refer to this in ‘The science of indeterminism’ [72], in the section on ‘messiness and heat’. 97 Stuart Kauffman (2017) https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27104 98 James (1995:274–5)

16 A riff on ‘turtles all the way down’ a saying that alludes to the mythological idea of a World Turtle that supports a flat Earth on its back. It suggests that this turtle rests on the back of an even larger turtle, which itself is part of a column of increasingly larger turtles that continues indefinitely. In our case, the processes become ever smaller as we reach the quantum realm. 17 See Elias (1994) The Civilising Process and Elias (1997) The Germans for an in-depth exploration of this point.

33 This is an approach – patterning not pattern, changing not change – adopted by Sharon Varney in Varney (2021:5) Leadership in Complexity and Change, where she speaks of the “dynamic patterning of, say, organisational life”.

34 Chaos is a tricky word. There is deterministic chaos, which is a feature of a particular sort of mathe-matical equation. Here I am referring to chaos in its more general sense, meaning randomness, and no established structures or forms; this was the sense in which Prigogine used the word. 35 Gunderson, L. H., & Holling, C. S. (2002). Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems. Island Press.

36 This whole section is based on Holling’s work, as described by Homer-Dixon (2006:226) in The Upside of Down. Chapter 2 of Boulton et al.

35 It reminds me of discussions about ‘African Philosophy’; for example, Tsenay Serequeberhan’s (1991) African Philosophy. It is often said that there is no or little indigenous African philosophy because there are no known African philosophers (Serequeberhan 1991:35). The point is that the philosophical tradition in African cultures tends not to be of the same kind as Western classical phil-osophical traditions, has not evolved by the same methods, and so it is overlooked and dismissed. By those writing more positively about it, African philosophy is regarded as having a “dynamic character to its ontology”, a “philosophy of unity and complete encounter of all things and beings” (Serequeber-han 1991:45) – which sounds rather resonant with complexity and Daoism. 36 Hall & Ames (1995:xiv)

37 Hall & Ames (1995:xiv)

38 A riff on ‘Yes we have no bananas’ – a song released in 1923. 39 The word acosmotic, whilst meaning there is no overarching connected oneness, does not imply everything is chaotic and disconnected. There is local coherence, but not total coherence (see [5] for discussion on coherence). The same point in made in complexity theory, which works with the middle ground between machine-like behaviour (we can know everything) and random chaos (we can know nothing).

40 Ames & Hall (2003:14)

41 Hall & Ames (1995:186)

42 The phrase ‘the ten thousand things’ is taken to mean ‘a myriad’ of things. There is an amusing story as to how 10,000 came to be the goal for the number of steps we should take in a day. Apparently, the idea of walking 10,000 steps a day was invented as part of the marketing campaign for an early pedometer ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The Japanese character for 10,000 (which is the same as the Chinese character) looks rather like a person walking so the device was called the Manpo-kei or 10,000 steps meter. It stuck!

Descartes’ view was that God gave us the ability to reason and thus reason would allow the revelation of His universe. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/des-cartes-epistemology/.

1 Morin, E. (2006). Restricted Complexity, General Complexity. Singapore World Scientific. 2 Systems thinking is a very rich and broad field; some approaches are based in computation, others are not. There tends to be a greater focus on uncovering the patterns of ‘what is’ and less focus on the emergence of new phenomena. For perspectives on systems thinking, I refer you to Michael Jackson’s (2019) Critical Systems Thinking and the Management of Complexity, Ray Ison & Ed Straw’s (2020) The Hidden Power of Systems Thinking, or Anna Birney’s (2017) Cultivating System Change. 3 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system. As explained in this reference, com-plex adaptive systems emerged from the development of nonlinear dynamical systems. 4 Title of a book by anthropologist Levi Strauss (1964) and also the title from an album by Fine Young Cannibals, released in 1989.

5 In Boulton et al.’s (2015) Embracing Complexity, Chapter Five, we deconstruct in some detail the different assumptions associated with various types of complexity models; we show how each type of model displays different attributes, some of which are in contradiction. It can be misleading to group together attributes emerging from differing mathematical approximations without exploring their provenance.

50 This does not mean that anything can happen; for example, path dependence explains how the past constrains the possible futures, as discussed in [15]. Equally, and confusingly, in the realm of mathematical models, there are certain types of mathematical models which do assume, a priori, that things move towards balance; this may be convenient, but it is a concerning assumption to make. See Boulton et al. (2015:89) for further discussion.

Glossary




Acosmotic: does not embrace the notion of an overarching cosmos; emphasises the importance of uniqueness, context and particularity.

Agonistic dissent: a concept in political theory where the focus is on acknowledging and embracing the inherent conflicts and differences within society as a necessary and productive aspect of democratic politics. Welcomes debate which neither suppresses conflict nor leads to violence; encourages the voicing of different perspectives and allows new solutions to surface. Autopoiesis: the inherent tendency of biological organisms to self-regulate and hence survive – through internal reflexive processes and interactions, coupled with engagement with their environment.

Axiom: a foundational principle or statement that is used as the basis for further reasoning or arguments within a particular field. Axioms are considered self-evident truths and are not thought to require proof.

Chaos: disorder and randomness. (Note that ‘deterministic chaos’ is a function of certain types of nonlinear equations and is entirely distinct from the general meaning of chaos.) Closed systems: systems that are isolated from their external environment, with no exchange of matter, energy, or information across their boundaries. Derivations within classical physics tend to assume boundaries are closed.

Coherence: no information is lost as things develop; there is perfect unbroken continuous connection – as would be found with motion on an unbreakable membrane or on the surface of a dish of mercury.

Context: the specific circumstances, conditions, histories and local environmental factors that surround and influence any event, situation, or interaction. Cosmology: in philosophy, cosmology involves the contemplation of the universe as a whole, considering its totality and the nature of existence; in physics, cosmology is the scientific study of the material universe, focusing on its structure, origins, and future development. Critical juncture: a pivotal moment, turning point or leverage point, where the potential for engendering change seems high.

Critical subjectivity: a deliberate and reflective engagement with one’s own, and others’, subjective experiences and interpretations, in a way that enhances understanding and leads to a considered view, often through actively engaging with and integrating multiple perspectives. Cybernetics: A field of study that focuses on how to control and stabilise systems using negative feedback loops.

Determinism: views the universe as unchanging and machine-like, governed by fixed, universal laws; the future is entirely predictable if one knows the starting conditions and the forces at play.

Discontinuity: occurs at singularities where traditional physical laws break down, such as at the beginning or end of the universe, or within black holes. These points are analogous to ‘tears in the fabric’ of space-time.

Dynamic stability: stability created by the combination of self-regulating interplay between elements, coupled with the propensity to interact with the wider environment.

378 Glossary



Emergence: the process through which novel properties appear, properties that have not previously existed and could not have been predicted; often (but not always) refers to systemic properties of ‘the whole’ that are not present in the constituent elements. (see Systemic emergence and Radical emergence)

Emptiness: a Buddhist concept used in certain texts (e.g. Milarepa text) to signify that form can only be understood in relational terms to is constitutive elements; form lacks substance. (see Pattern)

Entropy: a measure of disorder or randomness. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that that there is an overall decline towards disorder and increased entropy. Despite this, local decreases in entropy (increases in order) can occur in situations open to their surroundings, with which they can exchange energy, information and matter; it is this process that leads to star formation and indeed to life itself.

Episodic: a pattern of change that occurs in irregular intervals; typically marked by periods of relative stability interrupted by sudden, significant transformations. (see Punctuated) Epistemological indeterminism: the uncertainty and unpredictability in the universe due to practical limitations of our knowledge and understanding. This concept highlights that while the universe might be deterministic in principle, our inability to track every molecule, energy, and dust cloud leads to inherent uncertainty in practice.

Epistemology: the theory of knowledge, addressing questions such as how we gain knowledge, what counts as knowledge, and how we validate it.

Equilibrium: a state in which a situation retains balance and stability, with no net change over time.

Experiential knowing: a way of understanding the world through direct, immersive experience rather than through detached, analytical observation.

Flow: a central tenet of process philosophies that denotes the ongoing process of becoming, where change, and not stability, is the norm.

General complexity: an approach that emphasises engaging with the real-life complexity of situations, embracing their messy ambiguous paradoxical and emergent nature, rather than simplifying them into models or representations.

Hegemony: the dominance of one group over others, often manifested through cultural, ideological, or economic means. It involves shaping the culture, beliefs, values, and norms of a society so that the dominant group’s worldview becomes the accepted cultural norm, often to the detriment of diversity and equality.

Holism: a philosophical orientation that emphasises that the world tends to manifest as wholes or self-sustaining patterns; properties and behaviours of a situation cannot be fully understood by analysing the individual components.

Indeterminism: a view that the future is not fixed by preceding events and universal laws. Indeterminism allows for novelty and evolution within the cosmos, emphasising the effect of the particularities of history and of local conditions. (see Epistemological indeterminism and Ontological indeterminism)

Irreversibility: progression cannot be undone or reversed. Irreversibility is tied to the concept of path dependence, whereby what happens shapes what can happen next; it is implicit in ‘the arrow of time’, conveying the directionality of ageing and evolution. (see Non-ergodic) Local: emphasising the importance, in shaping the future, of factors present in the immediate situation and its surroundings, in comparison to a focus on the global or universal. (see Context)

Glossary 379



Lock-in: over time, certain patterns or behaviours become entrenched and resist change through ‘locking out’ the likelihood of any alternatives gaining traction; in social systems this is often facilitated through a reduction of diversity engendered through the constellating of power.

Machine thinking: a tendency implicitly to project a mechanical worldview on to situations and problems.

Mechanical worldview: a perspective that likens the world, or aspects of the world (such as organisations), to a machine composed of discrete parts operating in predictable ways according to definable laws.

Metaphysics: a branch of philosophy concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and existence. It encompasses a range of inquiries into what exists, how and why things exist, the nature of consciousness and the role of perception. It includes speculation about overarching questions that shape scientific and other considerations. (see also Naturalistic metaphysics) Mindset: a set of attitudes or beliefs held, often unconsciously, by individuals and groups and often seen as self-evidently ‘true’. It can include views on science, human nature, what we value and what we deem as acceptable and preferable behaviour. (see Worldview) Mutual entailing: the intrinsic interdependence and reciprocal influencing between entities and also with their context; in particular, the entailing of opposites – e.g. death is already present at birth, instability is not entirely separable from stability. Naturalistic metaphysics: a phenomenological approach to developing a metaphysics concerning the nature of reality; an approach that is grounded in empirical experience and direct engagement rather than initiated in abstract theorising. (see Phenomenology) Non-ergodic: future possibilities are shaped and constrained by the specificities of the path already taken; options are narrowed as events unfold, and choices are made; previous options are generally no longer available.

Nonlinear: a relationship between two factors that is not proportional; results in change trajectories that are not smooth, but may include runaway exponential change, or collapse, or result in periods of relative stability followed by sudden, rapid shifts. Oneness: Unity, the coherence of the whole, the absence of duality; the impossibility of aspects of the situation (the many) independently to display novel or unique behaviours. (Note this definition accords with a mathematical view of coherence, but there are traditions that view ‘the many’ as having a level of autonomy within the ‘One’.)

Ontological indeterminism: indeterminism that is inherent to the nature of the universe itself – due, in particular, to the paradoxical nature surfaced by quantum mechanics. Ontological resonance: a meaningful connection or alignment between different bodies of knowledge or perspectives that, although originating from diverse fields or starting points, arrive at similar conclusions or insights about the nature of reality. Ontological resonance can lead to a deeper, more nuanced understanding, and surface new ideas for practice from other spheres.

Ontological subjectivity: a form of intrinsic subjectivity introduced by quantum physics, suggesting that the universe has a relational contextual paradoxical quality at its tiniest scales; the objective ‘reality’ of the universe is brought into question. Ontology: a philosophical stance as to the nature of being and the nature of reality. It addresses, amongst other things: what is the nature of ‘reality’, is there a reality, are things stable or in flux.

380 Glossary



Open Systems: systems that interact with their surroundings, exchanging energy, matter, or information. Unlike closed systems, which have definite and impermeable boundaries, open systems are characterized by their ability to draw in resources from their environment, allowing for the emergence and stabilising of complex forms and patterns. Orthodoxy: the adherence to accepted norms, traditions, and established beliefs, especially within a particular field or system of thought. It often implies a preference for maintaining the status quo and a commitment to traditional beliefs and practices. Paradoxical: derived from the Greek para doxa meaning ‘against common sense’; the coexistence of seeming incommensurable factors, e.g. stable and unstable, structured and flowing.

Path-dependent: the future is shaped but not determined by its past, is sensitive to the details of the path that has been followed or has emerged.

Pattern: the systemic consequence of mutually reinforcing relationships; patterns are temporally or spatially situated, are sustained through the reflexive interweaving between their constituents coupled with engagement with their environment. Patterning: as a verb, the process of the formation, stabilising and dissolving of patterns; as a noun, signifies the processual temporary nature of patterns, held in place by reflexive relationships and through engagement with the wider context. Phase change: an irreversible shift in a system’s state, leading to fundamentally new properties. (see Tipping point and Regime shift)

Phenomenology: a philosophical stance that preferences the gaining of knowledge through direct experience thus avoiding overarching assumptions; emphasises the significance of individual lived experience.

Plasticity: the capacity for patterns and structures to adapt and reconfigure over time in response to circumstances, maintaining a balance between stability and flexibility. Polarity: involves two opposites that exist simultaneously. These opposites create a dynamic tension, which, if addressed simultaneously, can engender creative solutions and new understandings.

Processual: gives ontological primacy to change, flow, fluidity and becoming (as opposed to stability, fixedness and ‘being’).

Punctuated: highlights the episodic and nonlinear nature of change; associated with periods of stasis followed by periods of rapid change (in comparison with smooth or incremental change). Punctuated equilibrium: a term coined by evolutionary biologists who point to the way the fossil record shows that nature tends to have long periods of relative stability interspersed (punctuated) by times of major upheaval when many species become extinct and many other emerge. Extended to other disciplines, such as economics.

Radical emergence: new and unpredictable properties or behaviours arise, leading to a transformation that could not be predicted from the previous state; the entire landscape may be reconfigured. These emergent phenomena may or may not be systemic in nature. Reductionism or reductivism: the view that complex phenomena can be understood by breaking them down into their constituent parts.

Reflexive: the reciprocal, mutually impacting, reflective and iterative nature of interactions and relationships between entities.

Glossary 381



Regime shift: a shift to another regime or state, one which has novel properties not present in the earlier state. Regime shifts occur at tipping points – their novel properties may take time to emerge and stabilise. (see Phase change)

Reification: treating an idea or entity as self-evidently, unquestionably ‘true’ or ‘real’. Relational: the significance of interrelationships and interactions between elements, rather than viewing elements as connecting but unchanging; properties of resulting patterns or forms are co-constructed through their reflexive interactions. In quantum mechanics, relational quantum mechanics is concerned with the idea that properties exist in the relationship between ‘things’ not in the ‘things’ themselves.

Resilience: the ability to withstand and adapt to shocks, changes, and disturbances whilst either maintaining core functions and patterns or smoothly shifting to new forms more in tune with the developing conditions.

Restricted complexity: approaches to exploring complex situations that tend to rely on mapping and modelling and tend to be situated within the more reductive ontology of classical science.

Reversibility: the possibility of reversing or unravelling any change and returning to an earlier state. The mathematics of deterministic laws of physics have this characteristic; moving towards the future or towards the past cannot be distinguished. Runaway change: rapid, often exponential, irreversible change. Self-organisation: the process of the formation of patterns or forms that does not rely on external direction but arises from the mutual, dynamic interweaving between elements. Self-regulation: the process through which cells, ecologies or social systems maintain stability and dynamic balance through self-organising.

Singularity: points or conditions in the universe where normal physical laws break down. Associated with beginnings, endings and discontinuities, such as those found in black holes. More generally, in mathematics, a point at which the mathematical object ceases to be ‘well-behaved’.

Stasis: periods of equilibrium or relative stability.

Subjective: not entirely definable in objective terms, due to the perception of the observer, the inherent ‘fuzzy’ nature of what is being observed and the nature of ‘things’ as revealed in quantum physics.

Synergy: whereby the combined effect of multiple elements or forces is not additive but is greater than (or lesser than or different from) the sum of their individual effects. System: a set of elements connected together and working together, with defined boundaries; these may be constructed (e.g. a management system) or the term may be used more loosely (e.g. an ecological system). The reification of the notion of ‘systems’ as ontological aspects of the world is raised as a concern by many thinkers who situate themselves within the framework of general complexity.

Systemic: situations whose properties rely on the interweaving and reflexive interconnecting between its elements. Thinking systemically is to engage with problems through exploring many aspects and paying attention to their interplay.

Systemic change: approaches to change aimed at transforming the whole rather than just focusing on aspects.

382 Glossary



Systemic emergence: the process through which new properties arise through reflexive interactions. These emergent properties manifest at the level of the whole and are not present within individual components.

Systems thinking: paying attention to the collective and systemic properties of situations through consideration of the way elements interact; when referring to modelling and computational methods, may be situated within a restricted rather than a general view of complexity and may pay less attention to the processual, the qualitative and the emergent. Note the term is also used more generally to denote thinking systemically about situations. Tipping point: a critical threshold at which a final small change or series of small changes can cause a significant and irreversible shift, after which new properties emerge. (see Critical juncture)

Transdisciplinarity: an approach that transcends individual disciplines, going beyond interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary approaches in that it seeks to allow new holistic understandings to emerge that are not reachable within single disciplines. Unity: in science, equates to an overarching coherence and order resulting from unchanging eternal universal laws; unbreakable Oneness. (see Oneness) Weak signals: subtle, often early and easy-to-overlook indicators of emerging change; spotting them early, through paying careful attention, may convey advantage in deciding how to respond.

Worldview: a comprehensive framework of beliefs, values, and attitudes that shapes an individual’s or a group’s understanding of the world and influences their decisions and behaviour.
