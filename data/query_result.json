Stern supports his view of intersubjectivity as a source\nof motivation by noting that intersubjective motives have two characteristics that we\nusually attribute to a motivational system: a quality of need or desire, and speci\ufb01c sets of\nconditions under which these needs or desires become activated. According to Stern\nintersubjective motives can be speci\ufb01cally activated when (1) one\u2019s place in a group is\nthrown into question or when rapidly coordinated group functions are needed, (2)\nself-identity or self-cohesion is threatened, and (3) the desire for psychic intimacy is\ngreat\u2014as in falling in love\u2014a need that \ufb01ts the broader function of regulating psycho-\nlogical closeness and distance.

Kohut proposed three \u201cselfobject\u201d\nexperiences that could be expressed as idealizing, mirroring and twinship transferences\n(Kohut, 1971, 1977). The idealizing transference consists of seeing the other (often a\nparent in childhood) as being stronger and wiser than self and \ufb01ts with Bowlby\u2019s de\ufb01nition\nof an attachment \ufb01gure (being perceived as stronger and wiser). Idealizing, in this sense,\nis directly connected to the attachment system. The mirroring transference, however, is\nbased on the experience of being (or not having been) adequately recognized, validated\nand admired by parental \ufb01gures. The mirroring selfobject experience probably evolved out\nof the need to recognize members of the same species as unique individuals, a need that",

According to Benjamin (2004), this collapse of the intersubjective third leads into\na \u201cdoer/done to\u201d dynamic and according to Liotti the collapse of metarepresentational\nabilities leads to multiple and fragmented representations of self and other induced by\ntrauma and a history of disorganized attachment (Liotti, 1992, 2004). Unfortunately we\nwill have to leave further exploration of these important clinical issues for another\noccasion.\nAs language takes off in earnest by the second year of life, shared intentionality and\nperspective taking abilities take another giant step forward. With language humans can\nimagine how others might feel or think from many more perspectives. We can \u201ctime\ntravel\u201d and imagine what it might have been to live in the past and imagine worlds that\nmight not even exist.
