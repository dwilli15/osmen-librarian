Several authors\nhave begun to approach the relation between attachment and intersubjectivity (Cortina,\n2008; Diamond & Marrone, 2003; Fonagy, 2001; Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist, & Target, 2002;\nFonagy & Target, 2008; Gergely & Unoka, 2008; Jurist, 2008; Lyons-Ruth, 1999, 2006;\nStern, 2004; Stern et al., 1990).

We will\nnot address the second point in regard to self-cohesion because it would take us too far\na\ufb01eld, but we think it is also related to the importance of the group as a unit of survival\nduring human evolution. In terms of the third point about the need for psychic intimacy,\nwe agree with Stern that intersubjectivity becomes a motive that may be felt as a need for\nintimacy, but this agreement has an important caveat. From an evolutionary perspective,\nattachment and intersubjective motives belong to different levels of organization and have",

According to Stern intersubjectivity is \u201cnot only a condition of our humanness,\nit is also an innate primary motivation system, essential for species survival and has a\nstatus like sex or attachment\u201d (Stern, 2004, p. 97). According to Stern by the end of the\n\ufb01rst year intersubjective relatedness begins to exhibit a quality that is experienced as a felt\ndesire or need. He describes two main types of need: \ufb01rst, a need or desire toshare with\nothers and the need to de\ufb01ne and maintain self-identity or self-cohesion. This latter need\nechoes the enormous importance that Kohut placed on self-cohesion as an overall\nprinciple of psychic functioning. Stern supports his view of intersubjectivity as a source",
