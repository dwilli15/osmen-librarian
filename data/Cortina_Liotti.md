The relationships between intersubjectivity and attachment are beginning to be
explored within the psychoanalytic and developmental literature. We contribute to
this comparative effort by exploring the different evolutionary origins of attachment
and intersubjectivity. Five interlocking themes are central to this article. First, from
an evolutionary perspective, attachment and intersubjectivity serve different func-
tions. The main function of attachment is to seek protection, whereas the main
function of intersubjectivity is to communicate, at intuitive and automatic levels,
with members of the same species and to facilitate social understanding. Second, to
survive in changing and highly competitive environments, an evolutionary strategy
emerged among our human ancestors based on developing high levels of cooper-
ation within small bands of hunters and gatherers. In turn, high levels of cooperation
and social complexity put selective pressures toward developingeffective modes of
communication and more complex forms of social understanding (mindreading/
mentalizing/intersubjective abilities). These abilities far surpass mindreading abilities
among our closest Great Ape relatives. Third, we provide further evidence for this
hypothesis showing that in comparison with other Great Apes, young children show
qualitatively different levels of collaboration and altruism. Fourth, we provide an
overview of the development of attachment and intersubjective abilities during the ﬁrst 2
years of life that support the hypothesis of a cooperative origin of intersubjectivity. Fifth,

we return to the main theme of this article showing three ways in which attachment and
intersubjective abilities can be distinguished. We conclude by exploring some clinical
implications of this cooperative–intersubjective model of human development.

The Relations Between Attachment and Intersubjectivity
Theories in regard to attachment and intersubjectivity developed independently from each
other as can be seen in the classic contributions on attachment (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters,
& Wall, 1978; Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973, 1980) and on intersubjectivity (Aron, 1996;
Attwood & Stolorow, 1984; Benjamin, 1992; Ogden, 1994; Stern, 1985). Several authors
have begun to approach the relation between attachment and intersubjectivity (Cortina,
2008; Diamond & Marrone, 2003; Fonagy, 2001; Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist, & Target, 2002;
Fonagy & Target, 2008; Gergely & Unoka, 2008; Jurist, 2008; Lyons-Ruth, 1999, 2006;
Stern, 2004; Stern et al., 1990). Three distinct approaches can be discerned.
Is Mentalization Intrinsic to the Attachment System?
The ﬁrst approach, taken by Fonagy and his collaborators (2001), revises the classic
formulation of the function of attachment as protection in moments of danger to a
“mentalizing” function (we use the terms advanced intersubjective abilities, mindreading
abilities, mentalizing functions, metacognitive monitoring, and theory of mind (ToM)
more or less interchangeably).
1 Bateman and Fonagy deﬁne “mentalizing” as the ability
1 We think concepts of theory of mind (ToM), metacognitive monitoring, mentalization or mindreading
abilities, and advanced intersubjective abilities—that have different research and intellectual origins—are
nonetheless all pointing to the same basic phenomena, namely the ability to read the intentions, emotions, and
goals of others and the ability to observe and reﬂect on one’s own internal experience. This is less obvious with
ToM that has a strong cognitive slant and is measured by the use of false-belief tasks. Here is a simple example
of a false-belief task (Hrdy, 2009, p. 136). Ask a 2- to 5-year-old that is sitting in mother’s lap to watch
carefully while setting a cookie on a table. Then ask the mother to close her eyes and then hide the cookie in
your lap. With mother’s eyes still shut, now ask the child where his mother thinks the cookie is. Typically
developing 3- and 4-year-old children will answer that the mother will look in your leg. Almost all 5-year-olds
are able to put themselves in their mother’s place and say she will look for the cookie on the table (for review,
see Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). In the past few years, several studies show that young children can
“pass” false-belief tests if they do not rely on language—language may have a causal role in ToM develop-
ment (Astington & Jenkins, 1999; Lohmann & Tomasello, 2003). These nonverbal tests elicit children’s
spontaneous responses (as opposed to elicited responses that use language) and are based on anticipation-
looking tasks and violation-of expectation tasks that operate on the principle that infants and young children
will look longer at an event that violates their expectations. Based on these nonverbal tests, it is clear that by
the second year of life typically developing children can pass false belief tests (for review, see Scott &
Baillargeon, 2009). Using another experimental design that builds on infants desire to help others, Butterman,
Carpenter and Tomasello (2009) demonstrate that 18-month-old infants clearly can understand false beliefs.
Recognizing that ToM has a developmental progression has made it possible to begin to align ToM research
with developmental intersubjective theories (Beebe, Knoblauch, Rustin, & Sorter, 2005; Benjamin, 2004;
Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz, 1999; Stern, 1985, 2006; Trevarthen, 1980; Trevarthen & Hubley, 1978) and with
theories of mentalization that are also developmental (Fonagy et al., 2002)— but see Gergely and Zsolt (2008)
for a different point of view that sees mentalization as an innate social-cognitive evolutionary adaptation that
emerges by 12 months of age.

to understand the intentions, goals, and emotional states of self and others (Bateman &
Fonagy, 2004). According to Fonagy (2001):
......t h e early relationship environment is crucial not because it shapes the quality of
subsequent relationships (for which evidence is lacking, as we have seen) but because it
serves to equip the individual with a mental processing system that will subsequently
generate mental representation, including relationship representations. The creation of
this representational system is arguably the most important evolutionary function of the
attachment to the caregiver. Adopting this perspective helps redress the prevailing bias
against the centrality of the family as the major force in socialization, but it also shifts the
emphasis from content of experience to psychological structure or mental mechanisms
and involves expanding on current ideas of the evolutionary function of attachment.” (our
italics, p. 31)
Contrary to what Fonagy asserts, there is some very good longitudinal evidence
showing the effects of the early attachment relation on subsequent relations (Sroufe,
Egeland, Carlson, & Collins, 2005). Yet, our main disagreement with Fonagy is his
revision of attachment theory as serving a primary function of being able to read the minds
of others (the mentalizing function). Fonagy does not deny the protective function of
attachment, but he moves in the direction of making attachment theory into a theory of
mental representations of attachment-based relations. It is the case that the ability to
develop coherent representational models of the attachment relation is one of the most
important outcomes of a secure attachment history in humans. It is also the case that the
nature of these representational models strongly predicts the quality of attachment that
person will develop with their offspring (Fonagy, Steele, & Steele, 1991). However, this
does not mean that intensive parental care and the formation of attachment bonds emerged
during the course of evolution to have coherent representations of attachment relations.
Many mammals, like mice, exhibit vigorous attachment behaviors yet lack sophisticated
representational models of attachment relationships. Even primate species, like the ba-
boons, with a complex social life, lack full-blown mindreading abilities of humans that
allow them to understand attachment behaviors of juveniles from their perspective
(Cheney & Seyfarth, 2007). Here is an example based on an observation that the authors
dubbed “the Lord of the Flies incident” (pp. 163–164). Annual ﬂoods in the Okavanga
Delta in Botswana produce islands. Baboons have to swim to get around the ﬂooded areas.
Adult baboons carry the juveniles who cannot swim on their backs. On one occasion, the
adults crossed to another island, leaving almost all the group’s juveniles behind. Not
surprisingly, the juveniles found this separation very distressing, and they gave agitated
bark and scream calls that signal separation distress and huddled together at night. To the
consternation of the research team, the adult baboons heard the calls and looked toward
the juveniles, but except for one baboon, none answered the calls nor made an effort to
swim back to get the juveniles (the danger is real because lions often take advantage of
these situations). The authors’ interpretation is that baboons “do not appear to understand
that their knowledge and abilities are different from someone else’s” (p. 165). This
observation should serve as a cautionary tale suggesting that what constitutes an adaptive
attachment system in one species might look quite different in other species. This is
particularly so for humans, in whom intersubjective forms of communication are much
more complex and sophisticated than in other primate species, a point that we elaborate
in this article.

More recently, Fonagy and Target (2008) seem to have modiﬁed their position by
noting that in cases of trauma produced by attachment ﬁgures, the attachment system and
mentalizing abilities operate in an inverse relation. That is, a hyperactivation of the
attachment system induced by trauma dramatically reduces the capacity for mentalizing
functions. They point to an article by Arnsten (1998) that helps explain the neurobiolog-
ical basis for this inverse relationship. The attachment system and the mentalizing abilities
might be associated with a bimodal reaction to stress that “turns on” some parts of the
brain and peripheral nervous system while “turning off others.” During conditions of
uncontrollable stress—learned helplessness induced by trauma is an example—
catecholamine neuromodulators (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) are released
in the central and peripheral nervous system. In the central nervous system, these
catecholamines “turn on” the amygdala and “turn off” the prefrontal cortex. In the
peripheral nervous system, the heart and skeletal muscles are “turned on” and the stomach
is “turned off” to prepare for ﬁght or ﬂight. Fonagy and Target note that the attachment
system is closely associated with the subcortical right brain structures, whereas mental-
izing activities are linked to the prefrontal cortex and left brain. Supporting the latter,
recent evidence in 4- to 6-year-old children engaged in false-belief tasks shows increased
neural activity in the prefrontal cortex as measured by recording surface electrical activity
in the brain of those children who pass false-beliefs tests correctly, but not in children who
do not (Liu, Saggagh, Gehring, & Wellman, 2009). Although Fonagy and Target don’t say
so explicitly, all this would support the view that the attachment system and mindreading
abilities are functionally, physiologically and anatomically distinct systems.
Gyorgy Gergely—who had collaborated with Fonagy and others in a previous book
supporting a strong view of the causal and functional connection between attachment and
mentalizing function (Fonagy et al., 2002)— has now taken the position similar to ours
that attachment and intersubjective mentalizing abilities are functionally and developmen-
tally distinct but interrelated systems (Gergely & Unoka, 2008). Without denying that in
some situations, such as the case of attachment-related trauma, there are very clear adverse
effects on mentalizing functions, Gergely and Unoka dispute the view that “there is an
inherent, causal and functional link between the quality of infant attachment on one hand,
and the development of the ability for mindreading on the other” (p. 51). In support of this
view they note that the correlation between secure attachment and higher-order mental-
izing activities—as measured in theory of mind tasks using the false-belief testing
paradigm—are not very robust. They also note that there are many developmental factors
that strongly predict false-belief understanding by age four that have little or no connec-
tion to attachment. For instance, there is strong longitudinal evidence showing that
language has a causal role in theory of mind development (Astington & Jenkins, 1999;
Lohmann & Tomasello, 2003). There is also evidence showing that complementary role
playing, or the frequent use of words to name feelings used in some families (Cutting &
Dunn, 1999), or that having older siblings (Ruffman, Perner, Naito, Parkin, & Clements,
1999) also facilitate theory of mind development. All this supports the view that inter-
subjective mentalizing abilities have a line of development that is independent from (but
intertwined with) the development of secure or insecure attachment relationships. In sum,
we completely agree that in cases of trauma involving attachment ﬁgures, there is a
collapse of mentalizing abilities. But this adverse effect is very speciﬁc to relations that
may cue for traumatic memories and activate an already hyperaroused attachment sys-
tem—as can easily happen in psychotherapy (Liotti, 2004; Liotti, Cortina, & Farina,
2008).

Competition and Cooperation and the Evolution of the
Social Brain
There are other points of agreement and disagreement between Fonagy and Target (2008)
on one hand and with Gergely and Unoka (2008) on the other that we would like to
address, but this would require prolonging an already long article. Nonetheless, there is
one more point we want to discuss that is germane to a central hypothesis in this article.
Fonagy and Target support Alexander’s hypothesis (1989) that as humans became a
dominant species during the Pleistocene era, our main competitors became other nomadic
hunter gatherer groups. In this scenario, mindreading abilities evolved as the result of an
“arms race” that put selective pressures on mutations that fostered mindreading abilities
among our human ancestors incompetition with other groups. That is, what drove the
evolution of mindreading were strategies aimed at outwitting competitors by use of
subterfuge and deceit. This idea is often referred to in evolutionary literature as the
Machiavellian brain hypothesis (Byrne & Whitten, 1988). We do not doubt that compet-
itive evolutionary strategies supported the expansion of the neocortex and mindreading
abilities among our Great Ape relatives. What we want to add to this evolutionary
hypothesis is that the ﬁrst step that allowed our human ancestors to become a dominant
species might have been their ability to cooperate together in ways that far surpass any
known primate species. High levels of cooperation(rather than competition) put selective
pressures on mutations that increased social understanding and advanced intersubjective
communication. This idea is beginning to be referred to as the cultural intelligence hypothesis
(Boyd & Richerson, 2005; Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Henrike, 2005) or the
Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis in honor of the great Russian psychologist (Moll &
Tomasello, 2007). That is, the “arms race” with other groups initiated a mutually
reinforcing synergy between greater degrees of cooperation, mentalizing abilities and
cultural diversity (Richerson & Boyd, 2005; Tomasello, 1999). The need to compute this
level of social complexity within highly cooperative groups might have a causal effect on
the expansion of the neocortex in humans (Dunbar & Shultz, 2007).
Life History Strategies, Prolonged Dependency, and
Developmental Plasticity
In addition to a within-group cooperation/outer-group competition evolutionary model
(with selection taking place at the level of groups), there is some evidence that another
important evolutionary strategy responsible for the expansion of the neocortex was change
in the onset and timing of development processes, referred to in the evolutionary literature
as heterochrony (hetero /H11005different, chronos /H11005time; that is, changes in the timing of
development) or life history strategies. One important example of a life history strategy is
the slowing down or accelerating of development (Gould, 1977; McKinney, 1998;
McKinney & McNamara, 1991). Among our human ancestors there was a very signiﬁcant
slowing down of maturational processes, creating a very long period of development, the
most protracted of any known species (for review, see Flin & Ward, 2005; Gibbons,
2008). A slow maturation required intensive parental care of very immature (altricial)
offspring over a very long period of development. An important consequence of this
tinkering was maintaining rapid rates of brain development (more neurons and greater
synaptic and dendritic growth) into the third year of life (Finlay & Darlington, 1995;
Finlay, Darlington, & Nicastro, 2001). The very high cost of taking care of altricial
offspring over a very long period of development, had to produce a very signiﬁcant gain
in order for this evolutionary strategy to succeed. We think that the main gain was to

produce an unprecedented degree of developmental plasticity and adaptive ﬂexibility
among our human ancestors (Bjorklund & Rosenberg, 2005; Hrdy, 2009).
Are Selfobject Functions Part of the Attachment System?
A second approach integrating attachment and intersubjectivity taken by Joseph Lichten-
berg (1989, 1992), expands the concept of attachment as providing security, to include
many other important functions, such as affect regulation, validation, and recognition; that
is, “selfobject” functions (broadly speaking) proposed by Kohut and his followers (Kohut,
1971, 1977). Our objection to this approach is that it conﬂates the attachment system with
the caregiving system and with selfobject functions. It is the case that attachment ﬁgures
do much more than provide protection for their infants during periods of distress. Parents’
abilities to help regulate their infants’ arousal levels and emotions, to read their signals and
respond empathically to their needs—what Ainsworth described as sensitive responsive-
ness—are essential to help infants become secure in their attachment to caregivers. But
these are parental functions that are associated with the caregiving system, not the
attachment system. In the best of cases, attachment ﬁgures are able to integrate their own
attachment histories with intersubjective mind-reading and empathic abilities. Lichtenberg
agrees that the attachment system and caregiving system need to be conceptualized as
distinct but related systems (personal communication with Joseph Lichtenberg on
March 23, 2009). Making this distinction addresses some of the issues that get entangled
in thinking about attachment, parental functions, and intersubjectivity, and narrows
considerably some of the differences between our approach and Lichtenberg’s.
What about attachment and selfobject functions? Kohut proposed three “selfobject”
experiences that could be expressed as idealizing, mirroring and twinship transferences
(Kohut, 1971, 1977). The idealizing transference consists of seeing the other (often a
parent in childhood) as being stronger and wiser than self and ﬁts with Bowlby’s deﬁnition
of an attachment ﬁgure (being perceived as stronger and wiser). Idealizing, in this sense,
is directly connected to the attachment system. The mirroring transference, however, is
based on the experience of being (or not having been) adequately recognized, validated
and admired by parental ﬁgures. The mirroring selfobject experience probably evolved out
of the need to recognize members of the same species as unique individuals, a need that
was particularly important among our human ancestors who evolved in rich and complex
social groups. The need to be “mirrored” has a very different function than the safety
function of attachment. Of course, attachment ﬁgures that are sensitive to the need to
recognize, validate, and admire (when appropriate) their infants’ and children’s unique
emotions, intentions and mental states are more likely to develop a secure attachment with
them. Twinship transferences are based on the ability to see others “like me” while
assuming that others will also “see me”. This is not an attachment function, but an
intersubjective ability based on the capacity to imagine others as having desires, intentions
and mental states similar to one’s own (Meltzoff, 2007). This is the basis for the human
ability to collaborate and share with others as equals.
We agree that these are all important needs, but we think it is better not to lump them
all together as “attachment” but maintain a distinction between security and protection
(attachment), affect sharing/validation (intersubjectivity) and cooperation based on a sense
of mutuality and shared basic needs, desires and aspirations. From the perspective of the
infant, being able to integrate these two lines of development—attachment and intersub-
jectivity—is a challenge that will depend heavily on thequality of their relationship with

their caregivers and caregivers’ ability to respond to their infants as subjects in their own
right.
Attachment and Intersubjectivity Have Distinct Functions, But Become
Intertwined During the Course of Development
A third approach consistent with our general thesis of distinct but related functions
between attachment behaviors and intersubjective abilities has been developed by Daniel
Stern (1985, 2004, 2004) and Karlen Lyons-Ruth (2006). Our general approach is very
similar to the one taken by Stern and Lyons Ruth in seeing attachment and intersubjec-
tivity as two distinct domains with different evolutionary origins that are closely inter-
twined during typical development, but become disjointed during atypical development.
We also agree with Stern that intersubjective sharing becomes an emergent motivation in
humans. According to Stern intersubjectivity is “not only a condition of our humanness,
it is also an innate primary motivation system, essential for species survival and has a
status like sex or attachment” (Stern, 2004, p. 97). According to Stern by the end of the
ﬁrst year intersubjective relatedness begins to exhibit a quality that is experienced as a felt
desire or need. He describes two main types of need: ﬁrst, a need or desire toshare with
others and the need to deﬁne and maintain self-identity or self-cohesion. This latter need
echoes the enormous importance that Kohut placed on self-cohesion as an overall
principle of psychic functioning. Stern supports his view of intersubjectivity as a source
of motivation by noting that intersubjective motives have two characteristics that we
usually attribute to a motivational system: a quality of need or desire, and speciﬁc sets of
conditions under which these needs or desires become activated. According to Stern
intersubjective motives can be speciﬁcally activated when (1) one’s place in a group is
thrown into question or when rapidly coordinated group functions are needed, (2)
self-identity or self-cohesion is threatened, and (3) the desire for psychic intimacy is
great—as in falling in love—a need that ﬁts the broader function of regulating psycho-
logical closeness and distance. To understand the ﬁrst point—why intersubjective com-
munication and social understanding is related to group functions—requires situating the
emergence of advanced intersubjective functions in a larger evolutionary context of a
multilevel view of selection that focuses on the importance of group selection for human
evolution (Bowles, 2006; Bowles, 2009; Dunbar & Shultz, 2007; Wilson, 2002). We will
not address the second point in regard to self-cohesion because it would take us too far
aﬁeld, but we think it is also related to the importance of the group as a unit of survival
during human evolution. In terms of the third point about the need for psychic intimacy,
we agree with Stern that intersubjectivity becomes a motive that may be felt as a need for
intimacy, but this agreement has an important caveat. From an evolutionary perspective,
attachment and intersubjective motives belong to different levels of organization and have
very different degrees of speciﬁcity. By different degrees of speciﬁcity we mean two
things. Motives that emerge from the intersubjective matrix (intimate sharing and altru-
istically cooperating with others) have a less intense quality than attachment or sexual
needs, and the conditions under which intersubjective motives become active are more
general than the more speciﬁc conditions that activate attachment, caregiving or sexual
motives. Lyons Ruth (2006) makes a similar point, noting that intersubjective communi-
cation is not a motivational system in the same way attachment is a motivational system,
since in humans intersubjective communication has a ubiquitous role that permeates all
other mental functions and makes us uniquely human. We completely agree with her, and
we will provide evolutionary and developmental arguments and empirical data that

support this position. For now, we want to emphasize that these distinctions are not just
an academic exercise, but have important clinical implications that we will address later.
In keeping with Tomasello’s ground breaking theoretical and empirical agenda (1999,
2003, 2005, 2008), in addition to the desire to share experience with others, there is
another important motivation that emerges in humans during the second year of life: A
cooperative/altruistic motive to engage with others (mostly caregivers, but strangers too)
in the pursuit of joint goals and plans of action. This motive builds on the ability to
understand the intentions of others, a “we” or shared form of intentionality (Searle, 1995;
Tomasello et al., 2005). As Tomasello and his collaborators show (2008), this joint
intentional (and attentional) format becomes in humans the basis for a “cooperative
infrastructure in our species.” Tomasello and his collaborators have developed an impres-
sive research agenda showing how this cooperative infrastructure is fundamental to
understanding how high order intersubjective (mindreading) abilities, language and cul-
ture might have emerged during the course of human evolution (Tomasello, 1999, 2008).
Despite some differences with Stern in regard to whether intersubjective motives for
intimacy and sharing have the same degree of urgency and speciﬁcity as attachment,
caregiving, or sexual motives, we think Stern’s proposals are bold and break new ground
in several directions by considering intersubjectivity as a source of human motivation (a
proposal which has many similarities to Tomasello’s and Colwyn Trevarthen’s work) and
by linking intersubjectivity with group survival functions that enhance group functioning.
According to Stern (2004, p. 105) “intersubjectivity contributes to group survival. It
promotes group formation and coherence. It permits more efﬁcient, rapid, ﬂexible, and
coordinated group functioning and it provides the basis for morality to act in maintaining
group cohesion and language to act in group communication.” Stern does not offer much
evidence to support these interesting thoughts, a gap we will try to ﬁll in the next section
of this article.
Human Forms of Cooperation far Surpass Cooperative Behaviors Observed
Among Our Closest Primate Relatives
This section is divided in to four parts. The ﬁrst three parts examine the possible origins
of human hypercooperativeness from several evolutionary perspectives. In the fourth part
we turn to comparative data between humans and chimpanzees that supports the view that
human cooperation is qualitatively different from cooperative behaviors observed among
the Great Apes.
The Evolution of Human Cooperation
We think that the crucial adaptation responsible for the evolution of advanced forms of
intersubjective mindreading abilities has been the extraordinary increase in the level of
cooperation that took place among our homo ancestors (perhaps starting with Homo
erectus) during Pleistocene era or the era of ancestral humans—1.8 million years
to 10,000 years ago (Boehm, 1999; Bowles, 2006; Boyd & Richerson, 2005). A funda-
mental shift occurred during the course of human evolution from a social organization
based primarily on competition and dominant hierarchies that is prevalent among other
primates to a social organization based on equality and cooperation, as observed among
the few surviving bands of nomadic hunter gatherers that still exist in the world (Boehm,
1999). To avoid misunderstandings, we want to stress that although the main form of
social organization among primates is based on dominance hierarchies, this does not mean

that primates do not cooperate in many ways. They do, and the range of cooperation is
quite extensive. For instance, chimpanzees can establish alliances with others to maintain
their rank or to reach a higher rank (de Waal, 1982), and chimpanzees and bonobos have
been shown to engage in peacemaking activities (de Waal, 1989). Chimpanzees have even
been observed going out in hunting expeditions and will protect territorial boundaries as
a group (Goodall, 1986; Mitani, 2006).

Why would contemporary hunter gatherers serve as a model for Paleolithic hunters
and gatherers? A number of similar characteristics and conditions, such as patterns of
radiation, hunting for large mammals, unpredictable food supplies, investment in tech-
nologies that reﬂect seasonal changes, and tools use (“gadget technologies”) point to a
common matrix (Kuhn & Stiner, 2001). Moreover, Boehm’s review of available anthro-
pological data shows that the egalitarian organization can remain remarkably similar
across continents as long as hunter gatherer societies continue a nomadic existence
(Boehm, 1999). We acknowledge, however, that the hypothesized continuity of adaptive
strategies during middle to late Pleistocene era and contemporary hunter gatherers must
remain as a place holder until further evidence comes from different sources supporting
this linkage.
If selection favors individuals that look out for their own self-interest, how could this
level of cooperative and altruistic behaviors have evolved? Cooperative and altruistic
behaviors among closely related kinhas had a solid evolutionary explanation ever since
Hamilton (1963, 1964) came up with the brilliant idea that altruism can evolve by
altruistic individuals passing on their genes to blood relatives. One can think of this
strategy as a form of genetic nepotism, the closer the genetic relation, the more likely that
the beneﬁts of altruism will be passed on to the next generation. This theory is known as
kin selection or inclusive ﬁtness. In contrast to the ubiquity of the role kin selection has
had among many species of animals, including eusocial (truly social) insects such as ants,
wasps and bees (Hughes, Oldroyd, Beekman, & Ratnieks, 2008), cooperation and altruism
toward nonkin members of a group—such as the case of human hunter gatherers—is a
relatively rare evolutionary occurrence. The most widely accepted evolutionary explana-
tion for cooperative social behavior among members that are not related genetically is
based on the concept of reciprocal altruism (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Trivers, 1971).
Reciprocal altruism can be modeled on a tit for tat exchange of the type “I will cooperate
with you as long as you cooperate with me”: either person will resort to selﬁshness at the
ﬁrst signs of noncooperation. This is a conditional strategy that is only superﬁcially
altruistic since it is primarily motivated by self-interest. While we do not doubt that
different forms of cooperation might have evolved from these conditional strategies (such
as the ability of many apes to form strategic alliances in order to maintain or gain an upper
hand within social hierarchies), we think that they do not account for the type of altruism
seen in humans as observed among nomadic hunters and gatherers, nor do conditional
strategies explain the spontaneous helping gestures that 18-month-olds exhibit toward
strangers: these spontaneous gestures arenot based on rewards (Warneken & Tomasello,
2 As Tomasello points out (2008, p. 173), this type or group hunting does not mean, as some
have adduced (Boesch, 2005), that chimpanzees have coordinated plans with different roles to play
as is the case among human hunter gatherers. This type of group hunting is more akin to similar
group hunting activities among wolves, that ﬁrst surround their prey. Each individual member who
is closest to the prey will attack in sequence. This might seem like a coordinated “plan” of attack,
but it is not.

2006) nor do they ﬁt well with infant researchers’ observations of the sheer delight linked
to intersubjective sharing among infants and their mothers (Hobson, 2002; Trevarthen,
1988).
Another source of data that puts into question whether conditional strategies can
account for advanced forms of cooperation seen in humans are based on experiments in
adult populations using the “Ultimatum Game.” In this game, individuals are given the
choice to make more money (the self-interest strategy) or make less or no money at all
depending on how their opposite number behaves in each round of the Ultimatum Game.
In others words, the game pits self-interest against a sense of cooperation and fairness. The
results of many experiments using this game show that a sense of fairness (“a strong form
of reciprocity”) often defeats strategies based on self-interest (Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, &
Fehr, 2003). If individuals playing the game perceive that the offer is grossly unfair and
greedy, they will often refuse it, even if doing so means that they will not receive any
money at all. This strong form of reciprocity has been demonstrated in many different
human groups and cultures, a ﬁnding that supports the hypothesis that it is a stable strategy
inﬂuenced by culturally mediated norms of cooperation and fairness (Henrich et al., 2005).
A reciprocal sense of fairness is uniquely human. An experiment done with chimpanzees
engaged in a simpliﬁed version of the Ultimatum Game found that they are “self-
maximizers.” That is, they operate on the principal of maximizing gains in competitive
situations and make decisions based on self-interest (Jensen, Call, & Tomasello, 2007). It
is not that evolutionary game theories, such a reciprocal altruism are wrong. Reciprocal
altruism might account for the type of cooperation seen among nonhuman apes in
competitive situations involving forming alliances and coalitions with others, but do not
explain the strong tendency of humans to cooperate as equals based on a sense of
reciprocity and fair play, nor do game theories explain the human desire to cooperate for
the sole pleasure of sharing with others in joint activities (Stern, 2004; Trevarthen, 1988;
Trevarthen & Hubley, 1978).
An alternative hypothesis to reciprocal altruism to explain these deeper forms of
altruism and cooperation toward nonkin members is based on the resurgent theories of
group selection. Simply put, in competing against other groups, groups with more
cooperative and altruistic members will outcompete groups that are less cooperative and
altruistic. Group selection theories had been discredited for years, but they are now
receiving renewed interest thanks to the emerging multilevel view of selection. This
perspective sees selective processes operating at multiple and often competing levels:
genes within individuals, individuals within groups, and groups within a metapopulation
of groups (Boyd, 2006; Boyd & Richerson, 2005; Okasha, 2006; Sober & Wilson, 1998).
The multilevel view of selection preserves some of the insights and discoveries made by
kin selection (Hamilton, 1963) and of game theories (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981;
Maynard Smith, 1982; Trivers, 1971) but situates these insights within a more general and
inclusive theory that sees selection operating at multiple and at times competing hierar-
chical levels. A more precise deﬁnition of what is meant by a group from an evolutionary
perspective (based on a focus on traits such as altruism) as well as more precise and clear
sets of conditions under which group selection may prevail—in order to counteract strong
selective forces operating at lower levels of individuals— have made it possible to
empirically test group selection for any given trait. There is now a growing scientiﬁc
consensus that group selection has played a signiﬁcant role during the course of evolution,
and is particularly relevant to explain the case of human evolution (Boehm, 1999; Bowles,
2006; Bowles, 2009; Boyd & Richerson, 2005; Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Okasha, 2006;
Sober & Wilson, 1998; Wilson, 2002; Wilson & Sober, 1994).

Empirical Support for Group Selection
Samuel Bowles, from the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, has recently provided robust
empirical data that supports the importance of group selection on the evolution of altruism
and cooperation in humans (Bowles, 2006; Bowles, 2009). Two conditions that mathe-
matical modeling indicate would be necessary for group selection to prevail are present in
human hunter gatherer societies. First, there must be frequent contests among groups.
Contrary to what was believed, many nomadic hunter gatherer groups are not so peaceful,
and battles between groups have a high incidence of mortality because of the nature of
hand-to-hand combat. Successful groups will also reap the beneﬁts of colonizing the
territories of their adversaries. Second, there must be a system of sanctions and punish-
ment that spread the high costs of the enforcement of prosocial values (altruism, coop-
eration) to the group as a whole. Hunter gatherer groups perform this function efﬁciently
by the use of “leveling mechanisms” that function as a “social tax” and permit the high
costs of enforcing altruistic norms (and punishments for violators of these norms) to be
spread though the group as a whole, so that the high costs of enforcement does not fall on
just a few individuals (Boyd, 2006). This leveling function is accomplished through
shared cultural norms or values (an egalitarian ethos) enforced through shame, guilt and
ostracism, and occasionally even murder (Boehm, 1999). Cultural values among hunter
gatherer groups also stress the importance of sharing foods and socially imposed monog-
amy, thus reducing the ﬁtness differenceswithin groups (that otherwise will strongly favor
selﬁsh individuals). Group sanctions against free loaders to become effective require a
long time to become institutionalized, but recent modeling suggests that this condition was
met during the course of human evolution (Ga¨chter, Renner, & Martin, 2008). But once
in place, these sanctions become voluntarily accepted and do not have to be compulsorily
imposed (Hauert, Traulsen, Brandt, Nowak, & Sigmund, 2007).
It Takes a Village to Raise a Child: Other Evolutionary Adaptations That
Made Humans an Ultra-cooperative and Altruistic Type of Primate
Cooperative breeding refers to an evolutionary strategy in which the biological mother
(occasionally the father too) are assisted by other members of the group (“alloparents”) in
the care of their offspring. Cooperative breeding was ﬁrst studied in social insects and
birds, but it is in mammals and particularly primates that comparisons with humans are
meaningful. Of the 175 or so primate species, only half provide some type rudimentary
biparental care where mother and father do the protecting (Hrdy, 2005) and in only one
ﬁfth of primate species is alloparenting accompanied by provisioning (feeding) the young.
Only the members of the subfamily Callitrichidae and humans are full-ﬂedged cooperative
breeders combining substantial alloparenting and provisioning (Hrdy, 2009 p. 275). An
alloparent can be any member of a group, but most alloparenting is done by closely related
kin, as predicted by Hamilton’s theory of inclusive ﬁtness. Hamilton was also the ﬁrst to
predict that cooperative breading would be associated with slow maturing, altricial infants,
a prediction that has proven to be roughly correct (Hrdy, 2005). Why cooperative
breeding? Shared care frees the mother to engage in foraging activities with the result that
they can breed at a faster pace. In humans, life history strategies might also play a major
role. As we noted earlier, altricial (relatively helpless) infants, long childhoods and bigger
brains go together. According to Hrdy, alloparental care allowed humans to provide the
support to feed the large brain that consumes half of all metabolic needs in infancy. It
requires 13 million calories to raise a human infant to the stage where they are nutrition-
ally independent (Hrdy, 2005, p.15–16). What is even more interesting is that we are the
420 CORTINA AND LIOTTI

only members of the Great Ape family who are cooperative breeders (Hrdy, 1999, 2009).
Other apes, like chimpanzee mothers, are extremely possessive, and do not allow others
to take care of their infant. There are very good reasons for this. Other males who might
want to mate with the mother often resort to infanticide to restore the mother’s reproduc-
tive capacity inhibited by lactation. In some groups, if the mother and the infant are
unfamiliar to the group, other females might kill the infant and the mother. The fact is that
infanticide is a very frequent cause of infant mortality in many species of primates
(Cheney & Seyfarth, 2007; Hrdy, 1999).
Hrdy believes that for the combination of bigger brains, prolonged childhoods and
mindreading abilities to have emerged, cooperative breeding would have had to come ﬁrst.
We agree, but would add that cooperative breeding was not the only or even the most
important evolutionary strategy that led to this complex set of traits. Other species with
smaller brains can be cooperative breeders. A transition—via group selection—to soci-
eties composed of groups of highly cooperative and egalitarian hunter gatherers was also
essential. It was probably the combination of several evolutionary strategies working
together (life history strategies, group selection, kin selection and cooperative breeding)
that led to human ultracooperative, mindreading abilities.
Experiments Comparing Chimpanzees With Human Children in Their Abilities
to Cooperate and Share in Role-Playing Activities
Many might treat the hypothesis of cooperative origins of mindreading abilities based on
group selection and the signiﬁcance of alloparenting as another example of a “just so”
story. To counter this critique we have pointed to the population structure (in-group
cooperation out-group competition) and evolutionary mechanisms that support this hy-
pothesis, as well as evidence from contemporary hunter gatherer groups that is consistent
with it (Bowles, 2006; Bowles, 2009). But to carry weight converging evidence from other
ﬁelds is needed. We now turn to three articles comparing human children with chimpan-
zees in a variety of cooperative tasks (for review see Tomasello, 2008, 2009) that support
the claim than humans are a hypercooperative type of primate. In the ﬁrst study Warneken
and Tomasello (2006) presented 18- to 24-month-old human infants and three human-
raised chimpanzees with four experimental tasks, two that were instrumental in nature and
had concrete goals and two social games in which there was no speciﬁc goal except for
cooperating for the sake of keeping a social game going—like bouncing a ball together
and catching it with a can. The other important feature of the experiment was that the adult
partners would quit these tasks at a certain point and wait until their partner signaled a
willingness to continue the activity. In the instrumental tasks the human infants and the
chimpanzees did equally well. Chimpanzees were able to coordinate their behavior with
a human partner in order to succeed in the task. In the social games there was a marked
difference between the species. Humans took delight in the social games, whereas
chimpanzees did not engage at all. When the adult partner stopped the instrumental tasks
or the social games, human infants tried to reengage the adult, and even made the
instrumental task into a game. In contrast, chimpanzees did not try to reengage the human
partner in any of the four tasks. This was particularly noteworthy because food was built
into one of the tasks and chimpanzees are notoriously driven to obtain food.
The second study had a longitudinal design and involved three human raised chim-
panzees (Tomasello & Carpenter, 2005). Among many interesting ﬁndings, the authors
showed that chimpanzees were equally adept as human infants in understanding goals and
perceptions in simple cooperative tasks that involved exchanging roles. However, when
421ATTACHMENT AND INTERSUBJECTIVITY

humans forced a complementary role exchange on the human infants and the chimpan-
zees, human infants were able to exchange roles, whereas chimpanzees simply repeated
the same task with no reference to the human partner. Humans’ joint intentional and
attentional abilities allow them to exchange complementary roles. For example, chase–
ﬂee, buy–sell, come– go, borrow–lend, or complementary social roles, such as careseek-
ing– caregiving, student–teacher, victim–persecutor—an ability that implies the emer-
gence of a reciprocal type of imitation. Chimpanzees lack the ability for reciprocal role
imitation and cannot exchange complementary roles.
The third article is very revealing in another way. Hare and Tomasello (2004)
introduced apes to a game in which a human hides food in one of three buckets. A second
human, who acts as a helper, assists the ape to ﬁnd the food. Apes know from experience
that there is only one bucket that contains food and they have only one chance in picking
the right bucket. The experiment consists in the helper peeking while the food is being
hidden—the ape can see that the human helper is peeking. The helper then points toward
the bucket where the food is hidden. Amazingly, apes chose randomly. They don’t seem
to understand that the human helper is pointing to the food. The game is then modiﬁed,
but this time a competitive version is introduced in which in a warm up trial another
human begins to compete with a chimpanzee for food in the bucket. Without looking at
the chimpanzee, the human competitor reaches toward the bucket containing the food in
each try. After several rounds of this warm up, a Plexiglas is put between the human that
is competing for the food and the buckets. Because the hole is not big enough, the human
cannot quite reach the bucket that has the food, but the thwarted effort of an arm trying
to reach for the bucket containing the food clearly shows what the human is up to. In this
situation the ape will immediately reach toward the bucket with the food when the buckets
are pushed toward the chimpanzee. Why do apes not reach toward the bucket in the
cooperative/helping situation, yet immediately reach to the bucket in the competitive
situation? It is not that chimpanzees do not understand pointing gestures, as long as they
are raised by humans as was this case—see below. Several experiments have also shown
that apes understand the intentions of others in a variety of situations (Buttelman,
Carpenter, Call, & Tomasello, 2007; Call & Tomasello, 2003; Warneken & Tomasello,
2006). The only possible inference from this experiment is that in the helping situation
chimpanzees do not understand that the human is communicating with an altruistic
motive, but in the competitive situation they immediately grasp what is going on
(Tomasello, Carpenter, & Liszkowski, 2007).
The overall pattern suggests a qualitative difference in cooperation and social under-
standing between the two species. The ﬁrst difference has to do with motivation. Human
children are not only motivated to reach goals, but they are also motivated to cooperate
for the sake of cooperation. Chimpanzees are only interested in reaching a goal that is
self-serving as we saw in the last example. It is not in their nature to understand altruistic
helping— except among closely related kin, as when mothers take care of their infants—
but they do understand competitive situations and are very motivated to respond in these
situations. The second important difference has to do with social– cognitive abilities. In
the ﬁrst example, children understand there is a joint goal involved in all these tasks.
When this joint goal is breached (by stopping the activity) human infants try to reengage
their partners, whereas chimpanzees do not, even when the task involves a reward that
they are motivated to reach such as food. This suggests that the ability to engage in the
pursuit of joint goals is absent in chimpanzees. As can be inferred from the second study,
chimpanzees lack abilities for a reciprocal form of imitation that would allow them to

exchange complementary roles. Chimpanzees are goal oriented and they do understand
intentions, but despite their remarkable social abilities, social understanding is primarily
adapted to situations that involve competitive interactions. Chimpanzees simply “don’t get
it” when they are called upon to interact for the sake of sharing experience or helping
others in situations that call for a type of altruism and cooperation that seems to be
uniquely human.
The Ontogenetic Roots of Intersubjective Sharing and Cooperation in Humans
Primary Intersubjectivity
Another body of evidence that supports the hypothesis of the cooperative origins of
mindreading abilities is based on infant research. Colwyn Trevarthen is a pioneer in
tracking the development of intersubjective cooperation, sharing and companionship
(Trevarthen, 1979, 1988), describing primary and secondary forms (Trevarthen, 1980,
1988; Trevarthen & Aitken, 1994; Trevarthen & Hubley, 1978). During the course of the
ﬁrst year of life, parent-infant dyads respond to each others’ nonverbal cues, vocalizations,
gestures and emotions. The intricacy and subtlety of these “protoconversations” have all
the hallmarks of a well orchestrated dance. Infant cues are matched in timing, form and
intensity (all integrated cross-modally) by their caregivers (for review see Beebe, Kno-
blauch, Rustin, & Sorter, 2003). This match, however, is not an exact mirroring response.
Even at its best, there are minor cycles of disruption and repair even with parents that are
sensitively responsive and attuned to their babies’ communications (Beebe & Lachmann,
2002).
In addition, caregivers’ responses to infants’ cues and vocalizations use a simpliﬁed
and redundant grammar, a high pitched voice and exaggerated gestures. This form of
speech, “motherese” or child-directed speech (CDS), seems to be universal (Ferguson,
1962). Several functions have been attributed to CDS, such as facilitating language
development (Snow, 1972), emotional communication, capturing babies’ attention and
soothing children’s distress (Sroufe, Cooper, & DeHart, 1992). Another possible function
of CDS has been suggested by Fonagy et al. (2002). The “marked” emotional tone of these
interactions may help babies differentiate their emotional responses from their caregivers
exaggerated responses during these protoconversations.
Stern (1985, 2004 and Hobson (2004) have emphasized the affective core of inter-
subjectivity. Not only is there a correspondence of gestures and vocalizations, but there is
also an affective interchange that operates across different perceptual and expressive
modalities. This emotional correspondence, that Stern calls “affect attunement” concerns
how inner feeling states are shared (Stern, 1985, 2006).
3 Most likely, the affective core of
intersubjectivity provides a sense of continuity that bridges the dramatic changes in social
cognition that take place between the ﬁrst and second year of life. By the end of the ﬁrst
year and rapidly accelerating during the second year, infants use mothers’ emotional
responses to assess how they should react to unfamiliar situations, a phenomena described
as social referencing (Emde, 1992). Emotions play an essential role in the emergence of
primary and secondary forms of intersubjective sharing—me, you, and the shared world
3 This correspondence in gestures and emotions is likely rooted neurobiologically in a mirror
neuron system (Gallese, 2003, 2005, 2009), while the turn-taking abilities may have their roots in
the presence of adaptive oscillators (Port & van Gelder, 1995; Stern, 2004).

that is being explored. It is no exaggeration to say that infants begin to see the world from
the emotional perspective of their primary caregivers (Hobson, 2004).
Secondary Intersubjectivity: Why Pointing Matters
There is a scientiﬁc consensus that between 9 to 12 months of age there is a revolution in
human development that corresponds roughly to Trevarthen’s description of a secondary
form of intersubjectivity (Trevarthen, 1980, 1988; Trevarthen & Hubley, 1978). A very
illuminating way to grasp what the revolution is all about is by examining the seemingly
simple and humble gesture of pointing. Bates, Camaioni, and Volterra’s (1975) classic
article set the stage for all subsequent literature on the signiﬁcance of pointing as a “tool”
and as a prelinguistic form of communication. Elizabeth Bates and her coworkers made
the distinction between a pointing that is a request from the infant to obtain an object from
an adult: “give me the toy mommy’” (imperative pointing), and pointing that is a request
to attend to some external object “look at that ﬂower mom” (declarative pointing). The
ﬁrst type of pointing develops toward the end of the ﬁrst year of life, once infants have
developed the capacity to understand goal-directed behaviors and discover that goals can
be reached through different means (Piaget, 1952). Infants use imperative pointing
instrumentally to obtain objects from adults. This type of imperative pointing can also be
seen among nonhuman primates that have been raised in captivity or raised by humans.
(Tomasello & Carpenter, 2005), but it has only been observed once in the wild (Call &
Tomasello, 2003). The second type of pointing, which is declarative and triadic in nature,
involves infants sharing events or objects of interest with caregivers. Infants begin to
explore the world with others. Jerome Bruner (1977) was the ﬁrst to note that this type of
declarative pointing joins infant and parent in a meaningful social exchange that is
motivated by a desire to share attention toward an object with an adult.
Declarative pointing is brought about by new abilities: the capacity to maintain a joint
attention toward objects of interest, by the emergence of a bidirectional understanding of
goals and intentions between infants and caregivers, a “we” form of intentionality (Searle,
1995; Tomasello et al., 2005). At its simplest, joint attention can be seen when infants
begin to follow the gaze of others. But infants’ ability to follow adults gaze or point to a
target does not necessarily imply that the infants understand that others have intentions
similar to their own. The ability to understand the intentions of others is a necessary step
for declarative pointing to emerge. Declarative pointing is emblematic of a new form of
mutuality that develops during the second year of life, but soon expands to other
behaviors, such as holding objects up to show them to others and bringing others to
locations so they can observe interesting things (Trevarthen, 2005: Hobson, 2004).
The emergence of a role-reversal form of imitation (Meltzoff, 2005, 2007) and the
related ability to identify with the intentions of others (Hobson, 2004) during the second
year of life also allows infants to engage in games that involve reciprocal roles, such as
taking turns rolling a ball back and forth with an adult, taking turns in feeding, or more
complex games like peek-a-boo. By the time infants are 18 months old, a shared form of
intentionality and role reversal imitation set the stage for collaborating in joint plans and
shared goals, such as building a tower with blocks, or in tasks like picking up toys together
(Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello & Carpenter, 2005).
The Emergence of Perspective Taking Abilities
The ability to share intentional states with others has another fundamental consequence by
creating the possibility to take on the perspective of others (Barresi & Moore, 1996; Moll
424 CORTINA AND LIOTTI

& Tomasello, 2007). This is already implicit in the ability of 14- to18-month-old infants
to assume the role of others in social games and to coordinate activities and develop joint
plans of action. As Moll and Tomasello (2007) point out, by 18 months infants begin to
develop the capacity to see the same thing from their own point of view and the point of
view of others. Barresi and Moore (1996) believe that the ability to have a “bird’s eye
view” of ﬁrst and third person perspectives implies a representational capacity to view self
and others perspectivessimultaneously. This hypothesis connects with ideas put forward
by Jessica Benjamin of an “intersubjective third” (Benjamin, 2004: Aron, 2006). A
collapse of the ability to maintain simultaneously the representation of self and other
causes a reversion to a position where one can only see interpersonal exchanges from a
ﬁrst person perspective (“its all about me”), or a third-person perspective (“its all about the
other”). According to Benjamin (2004), this collapse of the intersubjective third leads into
a “doer/done to” dynamic and according to Liotti the collapse of metarepresentational
abilities leads to multiple and fragmented representations of self and other induced by
trauma and a history of disorganized attachment (Liotti, 1992, 2004). Unfortunately we
will have to leave further exploration of these important clinical issues for another
occasion.
As language takes off in earnest by the second year of life, shared intentionality and
perspective taking abilities take another giant step forward. With language humans can
imagine how others might feel or think from many more perspectives. We can “time
travel” and imagine what it might have been to live in the past and imagine worlds that
might not even exist. We can create narratives that include different cultural perspectives.
Examining how intersubjective sharing and a shared form of intentionality create a
common ground upon which language will ﬂourish, and how language expands the
perspective taking abilities by leaps and bounds is still virgin territory and an area of study
that is ripe for further exploration (Farrant, Fletcher, & Maybery, 2006; Hobson, 2004;
Tomasello, 2003, 2008).
The Emergence of Intersubjective Motives
The early signs of sociability are ushered in by the emergence of the social smile that
appears 4 or 5 weeks after birth and progressively becomes more prevalent and differ-
entiated in the following months (Sroufe, 1996). At ﬁrst, the smile is released by high
arousal states such as REM dreaming states, but by the fourth week of life the smile is
released by seeing a human face or the gestalt of the human face. By second to third month
of age the emotion that accompanies the social smile is also transformed from expressions
of pleasure to categorical expressions of joy (Sroufe, 1996). In contrast to attachment
behaviors that are powerfully directed at one or two attachment ﬁgures, by the end of the
ﬁrst year of life (“only you can comfort me”), the social smile is indiscriminate. Infants
will smile to anybody who smiles at them. Most adults ﬁnd these smiles, giggles and
babbling endearing and irresistible. The social smile powerfully promotes affective
sharing between infants and caregivers and unequivocally shows that infants come
equipped to engage socially with others soon after birth. In keeping with Stern, we think
that this form of engagement ushered in by the social smile is part and parcel of a larger
system of intersubjective communication that is present soon after birth, and continues to
develop throughout life. The communicative system has built into it a motivational
component. First, a desire to share feelings and by the end of the second year of life a
desire to share in more complex interactions such as social games and high levels of
collaboration required to construct joint projects, large and small. Trevarthen (1988, 2005)

and Tomasello (Tomasello, 2008; Tomasello & Carpenter, 2005) have proposed similar
ideas. Trevarthen has insisted on motives for cooperation and companionship that are the
key to the acquisition of culture and emotional expressiveness (Trevarthen, 2005). Along
very similar lines Tomasello (2005) has argued that a motivation to share intentions and
psychological states goes hand in hand with the enormous capacity for cooperation that is
the hallmark of our species and the basis for acquiring language and for cultural evolution
(Hobson, 2004; Tomasello, 1999, 2003, 2008).
As Lyons-Ruth (2006) notes, intersubjective abilities and motives permeate all other
motivational systems, including the attachment system. The evolutionary and develop-
mental framework that we have discussed allows us to return to a further examination of
the differences between intersubjective abilities and motives and the attachment system.

Three Differences Between Attachment and Intersubjectivity
Attachment Is a Domain Speciﬁc Adaptation. Intersubjective Abilities and
Motives Are Domain General Adaptations
The attachment system is one of several functionally discrete interpersonal motivational
systems observed in primates that serve vital adaptive functions such as providing
intensive parental care (the caregiving system), developing sexual partnerships (the sexual
system), and having privileged access to resources by establishing dominance over others
(the ranking system). In contrast to these more discrete functions, the main function of
intersubjective mindreading abilities is to provide an automatic and emotionally intuitive
system of communication among conspeciﬁcs. In the parlance of contemporary evolu-
tionary psychology attachment, caregiving, sexuality, and competition are domain speciﬁc
adaptations, whereas intersubjective mindreading abilities and intersubjective sharing
motives are domain-general adaptations. Cognitive psychology (Fodor, 1994) and evolu-
tionary psychology (Cosmides & Tooby, 1997) use the concept of modularity to refer to
these domain-speciﬁc adaptations. Modules are brain functions that evolved to solve
speciﬁc adaptation problems and are segregated from other brain functions. From an
engineering perspective, segregated modular systems have the great advantage of making
it less likely that their activation will interfere with other important functions that are
essential for overall functioning. From this point of view, social systems such as attach-
ment, caregiving, competition or sexual pair bonding have “modular” characteristics in
that they serve discrete needs and show signs of specialization and have their own neural
circuitry.
This does not mean we are committed to a modular point of view. However appealing,
the modular view based on engineering principles can be misleading when applied to
complex organisms. Engineering systems, no matter how sophisticated or complex, are all
dependent on preprogrammed information that is fed into the system. Living organisms
are the product of selective and evolutionary mechanisms and have conserved solutions
that have worked well over the course of millions of years. In simple organisms, some of
these evolutionary and developmental solutions can be assembled as independent modules
4 This analysis could also be extended to examine the relation between intersubjective abilities
and motives and other basic interpersonal motives associated with the caregiving, ranking and
sexual pair-bonding systems, but such an exploration is beyond the scope of this article (see Cortina
& Liotti, 2007a, 2007b; Liotti & Monticelli, 2008).

with little need of overall coordination. But in complex animals like primates, the type of
massive modularity evolutionary psychologists such as Cosmides and Tooby advocate
seems too simplistic and cumbersome—more than 30 modules have been proposed
(Buller, 2005). It is the case that if we examine adult brains, there are clear signs of
specialization. This has misled many to think that this specialization is a feature of the
innate modularity of the brain. Karmiloff-Smith (1992) has made the very cogent point
that the specialization in the brain may be an emergent phenomena rather than an example
of innate modularity. The specialization is the result of a general developmental process
that proceeds from relative undifferentiation to greater degrees of differentiation and
specializations of functions. Lately, Karmiloff-Smith had been calling for an approach that
recognizes the presence of innate biases or proclivities that interact with the environment
at every level of the organism. A similar model has been proposed by Edelman (1987,
1989) with his concept of values that are built into the brain (such as affective responses)
and help organize the emerging complexity of the brain. A commitment to a modular brain
with a multitude of specialized functions misses the point that perhaps the most important
characteristic of our species is its enormous potential for developmental plasticity and
adaptive ﬂexibility. This plasticity is typical of “generalist” species in which selective
pressures produced a brain in which conspeciﬁcs can learn consciously and deliberately
from each other and can adapt to changing local environments (Gotlieb, 1997, 2002;
Westen, 1999).
In short, we are in agreement with Karmiloff-Smith that domain speciﬁc or domain
general functions must be understood within an epigenetic perspective, in which there are
ongoing interactions with the environment at every level of the organism (Gotlieb, 1997,
2002). From this point of view we propose that advanced intersubjective cooperative and
mindreading abilities can be understood as domain general functions that are characteristic
of a species such as ours with slow maturing individuals with a very prolonged develop-
ment that promotes developmental plasticity and adaptive ﬂexibility (Bjorklund & Rosen-
berg, 2005).
Advanced Intersubjective Abilities Are Evolutionarily Newer Adaptations
With Respect to Attachment
MacLean’s model of the triune brain (1985) is a dated but still useful model that depicts
the hierarchical organization of the brain and helps situate attachment and intersubjectivity
as belonging to different levels of organization.
5 MacLaen organizes the brain in three
levels. The oldest brain (the R Complex) evolved among reptiles and amphibians and
contains anatomical structures such as the brain stem, the basal nuclei, and the cerebellum.
The functions of the R complex include regulation of essential physiological functions and
primitive instincts that involve minimal social interaction such primitive types of sexuality
and ﬁght/ﬂight/freezing reactions. The next level, the midbrain or mammalian brain,
contains structures such as the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and temporal lobe cortex that
regulate emotions and all systems of social interaction. The last level, the neocortex or
neomammalian brain, is found in the brain of higher mammals and is responsible for
5 This division of the brain is only a rough approximation, and contemporary neuroimaging
data show that the orbitofrontal cortex is in fact an integral part of the “limbic brain” in humans
(Decety, Jackson, Sommerville, Chaminade, & Meltzoff, 2004; Shore, 1994). Nonetheless, this
quick and dirty way of looking at the hierarchical organization of the brain is a useful heuristic.

higher-order thinking skills and language. More advanced domain-general intersubjective
motives and abilities (shared intentionality, mentalizing functions) are part of the neo-
mammalian brain.
If advanced forms of intersubjectivity that are uniquely human operate at a different
hierarchical level of mental functioning than attachment, we should expect in the infant
and the growing child differential effects on each of these systems as a consequence of
bidirectional inﬂuences on the other.
6 In a hierarchical system such as the one we are
hypothesizing for the organization of human interpersonal motives, one could hypothesize
that bottom-up inﬂuences stemming from right brain limbic structures that are part of the
attachment system (Shore, 1994) are emotionally more immediate than advanced top
down intersubjective abilities such as intersubjective sharing, cooperation and perspective
taking that involve neocortical structures.
7 The developmental principle that we support is
that adverse inﬂuences and disruptions of evolutionary lower-order interpersonal systems,
such as the attachment system, will quickly and necessarily inﬂuence higher-order
motivational processes and advanced intersubjective abilities such as sharing and coop-
eration. The reverse is not necessarily the case. Adverse inﬂuences and disruptions of
evolutionary higher-order abilities and motives, such as intersubjective sharing and
cooperation, will not necessarily impede the function of more basic interpersonal systems
such as the attachment system even though these disruptions will produce atypical
attachment patterns.
As we noted earlier examples of the ﬁrst situation—signiﬁcant dysfunction of a
lower-level social system, such as attachment, will have an immediate effect on a
higher-order social system, such as intersubjective understanding— have been well
documented. Fonagy and his colleagues have shown that the ability to mentalize (a
higher-order function) attachment related experiences is signiﬁcantly affected by
attachment related trauma (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004; Fonagy et al., 2002). In our way
6 In principle, the same type of reasoning can be applied to the relations between intersubjec-
tivity and other nonattachment-related (domain-speciﬁc) interpersonal motivational systems such as
the caregiving system, the sexual mating system and social interactions based on competition with
siblings and peers. During the second year of life, only three interpersonal systems are fully
operational: the attachment system, intersubjective sharing, and the emerging capacity to cooperate
extensively with others by taking into account their perspective and to some extent the ranking
system as expressed in sibling rivalry. The other interpersonal motivations we just mentioned
require more prolonged maturational processes and experience and become fully operative only later
in life. The study of the interactions between intersubjectivity and these other interpersonal
motivations are therefore less relevant for an understanding of the early reciprocal inﬂuences
(particularly during the second year of life) between attachment and intersubjectivity.
7 Neuroimaging data support the view that neocortical structures, such as the prefrontal cortex,
become activated when individuals are involved in interchanges that call for advanced forms of
cooperation that require judgments in regard to reciprocal fairness. In a recent study the research
team disrupted an area of the prefrontal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), thought
to be involved in judgments of fairness (Knoch, Pascual-Leone, Meyer, Treyer, & Fehr, 2006) in
individuals playing the Ultimatum Game. As we noted before, the Ultimatum Game requires that
individuals make a judgment of whether their partners are proposing fair offers. The disruption of
the DLPFC was achieved by local low-frequency repetitive transcranial stimulation. The disruption
of the right DLPFC reduced subjects’ willingness to reject their partners’ unfair offers, even though
they still judged the offers as unfair. That is, the local stimulation of the DLPFC temporarily
disrupted the ability to engage in fair play. The stimulation of the left DLPFC did not have the same
effect. This indicates that interference with right brain DLFPC function interferes with maintaining
a sense of reciprocal fairness and mutuality that is required in order to cooperate at higher levels.

of putting it, individuals with a history of disorganized attachment construct poorly
integrated internal working models of self and others. New stressful situations or
trauma activate the attachment system, producing a collapse of advanced intersubjec-
tive abilities and further fragmentation (Liotti et al., 2008). For instance Hill, Lei-
deken, & Sharp (2008) observe that insecure attachment at 18 months was associated,
in 5-year old children, with indices of low mentalizing in an emotionally laden dolls’
house scenario (Bad and Nasty Time), but not in a neutral scenario (Bed Time). This
ﬁnding suggests that the activation of insecure or traumatic internal working models
of attachment, and the activation of strong emotion linked to separation anxiety,
adversely inﬂuence one of the crucial aspects of intersubjectivity, namely, the ability
to maintain a good understanding of intentions and emotions of others (mentalizing
abilities).
When the attachment system isnot chronically aroused the capacity for collaboration
emerges, as evidenced by the ability of children to reengage in intersubjective sharing
through reciprocal imitation and pretend play, abilities that go hand in hand with higher
degrees of mentalization (Hill et al., 2008). As intersubjective abilities become increas-
ingly integrated with the attachment system during the course of normal development,
they become a necessary condition for the smooth exercise of all other interpersonal
motivational systems, such as the ability to cooperate and compete successfully with peers
and siblings (Sroufe et al., 2005).
Autism is an example of the second situation—adverse inﬂuences or disruptions of
higher order intersubjective functions will not necessarily disrupt lower-order func-
tions. Many autistic individuals with severe intersubjective deﬁcits can maintain an
attachment to important people in their lives, albeit a very atypical attachment (Stern,
2004). The fact remains that the attachment system is still operational in autistic
individuals, even though its quality is signiﬁcantly disturbed. A high functioning
autistic person, Temple Grandin, reports memories suggesting normal wishes for
attachment interactions when she was a child (Grandin, 1992). In a conversation with
Oliver Sacks she discussed her memories of longing to be soothed by a caregiver’s
hug, and her feelings of comfort while she was in the caregiver’s arms (Sacks, 1995).
The problem with satisfying her normal wishes for attachment was her inability to
cope with overwhelming feelings of unpredictability and uncontrollability generated
during interpersonal exchanges. The deﬁcit in intersubjectivity inﬂuenced attachment
(and all types of interpersonal behaviors) in later phases of the development of the
disorder. These deﬁcits are not the consequence of parental insensitivity or frightened
and/or frightening caregiver’s responses to her attachment needs, as would have been
true of a child disorganized in her attachment (Hesse, Main, Abrams, & Rifkin, 2003).
Rather, they are the result of her difﬁculty in the intersubjective sharing and under-
standing of motives, emotions, and intentions.
A recent article experimentally tested this hypothesis comparing autistic children
with matched control groups of mentally retarded, language-delayed, and normally
developing children (van IJzendoorn et al., 2007). The results show unequivocally, as
predicted, that parental sensitivity affected the quality of the attachment relation with
mentally retarded and typical developing children, but had no discernable effect on
autistic children. While there were more atypical and insecure attachment patterns
with autistic children, these patterns were unrelated to parental sensitivity. The clear
inference is that the insecure and atypical attachment patterns of autistic children are
not caused by parent– child attachment difﬁculties, but are caused by the intersubjec-

tive deﬁcits of autistic children—their inability to correctly read and interpret the
emotions and communications of their parents.
In the absence of more empirical research on the reciprocal inﬂuences (positive and
negative) between attachment and intersubjectivity, these examples may provide illustra-
tions of the principle of hierarchical organization of motivational systems and intersub-
jective abilities.
Intersubjectivity Is Activated Tonically, Attachment Is Activated in Phases
A metaphor from the physiology of muscle activity captures another important difference
between intersubjectivity and attachment. Like the tone in a living muscle, intersubjective
sharing and cooperation are “tonically” active—it may change in its motivational inten-
sity, but never disappears totally from the mental activity that is the basis of human
higher-order consciousness (Edelman, 1989). As long as there is higher-order conscious-
ness there are advanced forms of intersubjectivity that involve sharing of experience from
multiple perspectives through gestures or language (Cortina & Liotti, in press). Even when
we are alone, every single perception that emerges in higher-order consciousness becomes
conscious from the perspective of being potentially communicable to another human
being (Barlow, 1980). When we become conscious of anything, we are (even if only
latently) prone to communicate it to somebody else.
In contrast, domain-speciﬁc interpersonal motivations are “phasically” active. They
work in phases, in a manner that is similar to the speciﬁc sequences of muscle contractions
and relaxation that are coordinated to attain speciﬁc goals. Any conscious activity that
takes place in phases has a beginning and an end, a rule of activation and a rule of
termination, and will fade in and out of conscious awareness, while a tonic activity is, so
to speak, always “tonically” present.
Furthermore, it is possible to specify the rule of activity and the rule of termination of
every interpersonal motivation system, but despite what Stern (2004) asserts, this is not so
clear with intersubjective motives that are better seen as general-purpose default systems
that remain tonically active. Sharing experience with others and being able to examine
experience from multiple perspectives is the normal default system in humans. This
intersubjective motive and ability for mutual perspective taking might collapse tempo-
rarily under strain, but will assert itself vigorously as soon as the emergency is over. The
cooperative motive to help others and engage in human communication through gestures
and language is also a pervasive state of being. The sharing and cooperative motives in
humans remain tonically active in most circumstances, even when the domain speciﬁc
motivation such as sexuality, attachment and competition are normally active. Even in
highly competitive activities like games, sports and scientiﬁc endeavors, a cooperative
infrastructure undergirds many competitive activities. Indeed, as Piaget (1965) showed in
his classic book on the origins of morality in children, a set of rules have to be
consensually agreed upon and reciprocally enforced before school-age children can
participate in games with peers such as playing marbles. It is only in pathological
conditions such as autism, or where there is a history of attachment trauma, that
intersubjective abilities and motives to share and cooperate with others are seriously
compromised or limited.
In domain-speciﬁc adaptations such as the interpersonal motives of attachment,
caregiving, or ranking systems, the rules of activation and deactivation are clearly deﬁned
and speciﬁc. Activation of the attachment system coincides with perceived distress, fear,
vulnerability or loneliness, while termination coincides with attaining protective proximity

of an attachment ﬁgure and/or with perceived safety. The caregiving system is activated
by signals of vulnerability, danger or distress in juvenile members of the social group with
whom an attachment relationship has been established. The caregiving system’s stopping
rule coincides with the successful soothing of the other’s distress. The sexual system—
activated by proper secretion of sexual hormones and pheromones in interplay with
sexually arousing stimuli of potential mates—is usually terminated by orgasm. Among
primates, the ranking system is activated by threats of losing rank (and hence losing
control of environmental resources and/or preferential access to mating partners) and is
terminated by signals of yielding or submission (Gilbert, 1989). Needless to say, the
triggers that activate competitive struggles and desire for dominance over others in
humans are much more complex and less ritualistic. Humans have created competitive
games and contests that are governed by rules of fair play and reciprocity. Contests can
range from being very playful to being ﬁercely contested, as is the case in many individual
and team sports, but there are explicit rules and sanctions that prevent competition from
becoming violent. These are some of the important differences, but we can still see the
clear evidence of this ancient motivational system in the case of bullies, in sado-
masochistic phenomena and in political struggles over power. One only has to read Franz
de Waal’s description of power politics among the apes (de Waal, 1982) along with
Machiavelli’sThe Princeto realize how little has changed in the quest for rank and power
among human and nonhuman apes.
Some Clinical Implications
Attachment, Intersubjectivity, and the Therapeutic Alliance
Perhaps the single most important clinical application of being able to distinguish the
different prosocial functions and motives associated with attachment and intersubjectivity
is that it provides a good theoretical model that helps us think about establishing a
therapeutic alliance during the course of psychotherapy. Numerous studies have pointed
out that the single most important factor predicting the effectiveness of psychotherapy,
regardless of the type of psychotherapy that is practiced, is the quality of the patient–
therapist relation (Hovarth, 2001; Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000). The more a patient
feels understood, feels that the therapist is able to read his or her signals and communi-
cations, and feels safe with the therapist, the better the outcome. These qualities are all
dependant on intersubjective and attachment functions. Feeling understood and being able
to take a different perspective on emotional problems are mentalizing/ intersubjective
functions. Feeling that one’s therapist is a reasonably protective and trustworthy ﬁgure is
an attachment related function.
Ever since Freud wrote his papers on technique almost 100 years ago, it has been
widely accepted by psychodynamic therapists of all stripes that development of an
“unobjectionable” positive transference is one of the most important leverages that help
push the therapeutic tasks forward (Freud, 1912). Of course, outcomes are dependent on
many other variables, but a positive transference, like smooth sailing, makes getting to any
destination a much easier task. Freud was also the ﬁrst to recognize that establishing a
positive transference— based on parental imagoes stemming from childhood, what we
now describe as positive attachment experiences—was one of the keys for a successful
analysis. Even to the end of his career, in one of the most sober assessments of the limits
of psychoanalysis (Analysis Terminable or Interminable) he continued to believe in the

power of a positive transference (Freud, 1937). But what happens when these positive
attachment experiences from childhood are not present or when these attachment expe-
riences have been traumatic?
Many changes in technique in psychoanalysis came about in order to be able to work
with patients who have unstable relations, are very impulsive, have intense, extremely
ambivalent relations to others and toward the therapist and have a history of traumatic or
disrupted attachments. When the attachment relation is activated in the transference with
this population, it cues these traumatic memories and the result may be disorganized or
dissociated responses. There is a consensus among attachment-informed therapists that
this early activation of attachment in therapy should be avoided or side stepped to the
extent possible until a base of cooperation and trust has been established that will allow
for the gradual working through of these traumatic experiences (Bateman & Fonagy,
2004; Holmes, 2001; Liotti et al., 2008; Slade, 1999). A high degree of cooperation,
mutuality and reciprocity is built into human intersubjectivity based on these representa-
tional abilities, but this mutuality is fragile. Clinical experience and a growing body of
research (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004) is showing these representational abilities can
temporarily collapse under severe psychological strain—as when attachment trauma is
activated (see below). Liotti et al. (2008) have described the same phenomena as the
collapse of intersubjective abilities.
If we are not in a position to establish a haven of safety and a secure base from which
to explore because of a history of attachment trauma what can be done? We have other
prosocial motivations to draw from that are not disorganizing, namely a desire to
collaborate with the therapist in order to reduce suffering (the cooperative motive) and a
desire to share experience with others who are seen as being like me (Kohut’s mirroring
and twinship selfobject needs). We can build on collaborative sharing motives by
establishing joint therapeutic tasks that are not threatening, such as helping patients
regulate intense affects by developing a better understanding of situations that might
trigger disruptive emotions, establishing clear, consistent and ﬂexible boundaries, working
toward reducing self-injurious and destructive behaviors by developing alternative self-
soothing techniques or any other therapeutic goals that can be agreed upon. These
measures build a sense of trust and hope and create a reservoir of good will that we can
draw from when the inevitable disruptions occur.
Another approach we have been experimenting with is having two therapists collab-
orate closely in different settings in order to decrease the likelihood that disruptions with
one therapist will terminate the treatment by having a secondary therapist provide
additional support. The second therapist can be a psychiatrist who medicates the patient
and is versed in dealing with this type of patient, a group therapist, a marital therapist or
even another individual psychotherapist. The key to success is that both therapists share
a common theory and approach to treating these challenging patients, that they respect
each other’s work, and are in constant communication and consultation (Liotti et al.,
2008).
Lessons Learned From Children Placed in Foster Care
After Early Attachment Traumas
It is now well known that early relational traumas such as those caused by frightened
and/or frightening caregiving behavior (Hesse et al., 2003), can lead to disorganization of
early attachments. Attachment disorganization is characterized by interactions with care-
432 CORTINA AND LIOTTI

givers in which the child is likely to experience “fright without solution.” This causes
children (and also adults coming from histories of severe attachment disorganization) to
tend to respond with anticipatory fear and/or dissociation whenever their attachment
system becomes active (Hesse et al., 2003; Liotti, 1999, 2000, 2004). Particularly severe
early traumas and institutional deprivation of stable caregiving can yield not only disor-
ganization of attachment, but also indiscriminately friendly behavior toward strangers
(O’Connor, 2002).
Controlling strategies—that inhibit the attachment system through the defensive,
vicarious activation of the caregiving system (inverted attachment) or of the ranking
system with its punitive-dominant behavior (Liotti, 2004, pp. 480 – 481)—seem the only
solution these children can ﬁnd to avoid the repetition of fright and dissociation whenever
the attachment system tends to become active. Descriptions of the controlling-caregiving
and controlling-punitive strategies employed by children who had been disorganized in
their infant attachments, have been provided by Hesse et al. (2003) and by Lyons-Ruth
(2003). When the conditions for the activation of the attachment system are sufﬁciently
intense or prolonged, the relative inhibition by the defensive activation of the caregiving
or the ranking system may be overcome. The disorganized representation of the attach-
ment relation may then be activated, with its cohort of sometimes dramatic, frightening
dissociative experiences (Hesse, 2003; Liotti, 1999; Liotti, 2000; Liotti, 2004; Lyons-
Ruth, 2003).
Clinicians treating children placed in foster care after repeated attachment injuries and
severe abuse have noted extremely abnormal responses of these children when their
attachment needs become active. These children also show deﬁcits in their capacity for
joyful intersubjective exchanges. In these traumatized children, the dynamic relation
between (a) poor intersubjective responses to opportunities for joyful intersubjective
sharing, and (b) abnormal expression of attachment needs, is of an altogether different
kind than observed in autistic children. Two clinical vignettes may illustrate the
difference.
8
A preadolescent girl was interviewed together with her foster parents after a night
when she trashed her room in an uncontrollable storm of fear and rage. A few hours
before, the child and her foster parents had enjoyed particularly happy exchanges,
laughing together at the foster father’s funny stories of his years in college. They were able
to relax afterward in front of the TV screen before going to their bedrooms for the night.
This foster child was able to explain her behavior during the interview: “I went into a
panic last night because I thought we had been having fun. Fun is dangerous.” The
therapist thought that the little girl had felt particularly close to her foster parents during
and after the positive intersubjective exchange. This closeness primed the activation of her
attachment wishes—a likely event when a child feels alone at night-time. In turn, this
activation elicited, at an implicit level of mental functioning, her disorganized mental
representations or internal working models (IWM) portraying memories of fright without
solution. She intuited that there was a relationship between having had fun with her foster
parents (positive intersubjective sharing) and expecting undeﬁned but catastrophically

treatment of foster parents and children placed in their care after having been exposed to severe
attachment traumas (Alec Clark, personal communication with Giovanni Liotti, May 7, 2007).

negative events (activation of the IWM of a traumatic attachment), and drew the conclu-
sion that fun is dangerous.
Here is the second vignette. In the course of regularly scheduled consultations, a foster
parent sends the therapist weekly reports on signiﬁcant exchanges between her and the six
year old girl who has been placed in her care about one year before. Thelittle girl, B.,
had been removed from a chaotic abusive household 3 years before. The following is
an abstract from one of the foster-parent’s reports’: “B. loves to do my hair and
pretend to paint my nails, and in return she loves me to do the same to her... Sud-
denly she said, ‘I love you, I really do.’ I didn’t want to spoil the moment so I said
nothing but gently cradled her like a baby.” A week later the foster-parent reported:
“B. started screaming as soon as I left the room, ‘I f* hell hate you. I’m going to f*
punch you ...o wwwww . . . I’m hurt now and it’s your fault. It’s your fault I have
hurt myself.’”
According to the therapist, this little girl switches unpredictably, but almost on a daily
basis, from joyful, playful exchanges with her foster parent to bouts of aggression, fear,
and despair such as the one reported. The therapist’s formulation is that her foster parent’s
offering of playful intersubjective exchanges accompanied by empathic attitudes (“I
gently cradled her like a baby”) is weakening B’s controlling defenses, so that her
attachment system becomes active and B is overwhelmed with memories— expectations
of pain and danger.
Concluding Remarks
We have shown that while attachment and intersubjectivity are intimately related through
development, they can be distinguished on several evolutionary and developmental
grounds. We argue that the most important evolutionary strategy driving human evolution
was the emergence of cooperative groups that were able to share resources on an equal
basis and therefore compete favorably with other groups (group selection). This evolu-
tionary strategy most likely coevolved with cooperative breeding and life history strate-
gies as Hrdy has persuasively argued. The emergence of a hypercooperative form of
sociability required more effective communication between group members. A better
understanding of the intentions and motives of other members assisted in joint cooperative
planning of hunting and gathering activities among nomadic groups during the course of
human evolution. Understanding intentions, motives and mental states of others takes
place at an intersubjective level. This rich interpersonal and experiential matrix provides
a fertile common ground upon which symbolic activities and language emerge.
We use this evolutionary and developmental framework to further understand and
reﬁne the differences between attachment and intersubjectivity based on three conceptual
arguments: (1) the distinction between domain-speciﬁc and domain-general adaptations,
(2) the difference between tonic and phasic forms of activation and rules of activation and
deactivation and, (3) the different hierarchical levels involving intersubjective motives
(sharing and cooperating) and attachment motives. These differences lead us to expect
different types of consequences resulting from the dynamic interplay between the two
systems. Domain-speciﬁc motivational systems (attachment, caregiving, ranking, and
sexual pairing systems) can generate powerful and intense emotions that can hinder
positive intersubjective exchanges. Deﬁcits in positive intersubjective exchanges, such
as observed in autism, involve less intense emotions, but can interfere with all the
interpersonal motives. Exploring the clinical implications of these views is new
